# Antibiotic-resistance Staphylococcus aureus isolated from cow’s milk in the Hawassa area, South Ethiopia

Abstract


Background: Quarter milk samples from cows were examined to determine the prevalence of Staphylococcus
aureus (SA) and different antibiotic resistant pattern were determined in a cross-sectional study design.
Objective: The objective of this study was to isolate Staphylococcus aureus from samples of cow’s milk obtained
from Hawassa area and to determine their antibiotic susceptibility patterns.


Method: A total of 160 milk (CCP1-CCP5) samples were collected and screened for the presence of S. aureus. Gram
staining, oxidase, catalase, DNase, haemolysis and coagulase tests were employed for bacterial identification.


Results: All the samples were contaminated with S. aureus. A total of 78 S. aureus isolates were obtained during this
study. The levels of contamination with S. aureus were higher in milk obtained from CCP1, CCP2, CCP3, CCP4 and
CCP5 at Hawassa area farms (18.0%, 25.6%, 27.0%, 21.8% and 7.7%) respectively. A large percentage of the S. aureus
isolates (25.6% and 27.0%) were from CCP2 and CCP3. All strains were resistant to Penicillin G (PG) (10 μg), Ampicillin
(AP) (10 μg), Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid (AC) (30 μg), Ciprofloxacin (CIP) (5 μg), Erythromycin (E) (15 μg), Ceftriaxone
(CRO) (30 μg), Trimethoprime-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) (25 μg) Oxacillin (Ox) (1 μg) and Vancomycin (V) (30 μg),
67.9%, 70.9%, 30.9%, 0%, 32.1%, 23.1%, 7.7%, 60.3% and 38.5% respectively.


Conclusion: The proportion of isolates resistant to CIP, TMP-SMZ, CRO, AC, E and V were low compared to AP, PG and
Ox. S. aureus is normally resident in humans; therefore, the S. aureus present in the cow’s milk may have resulted from
transmission between the two species, emphasizing the need to improve sanitary conditions in the milking
environment.

Introduction
Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous human pathogen
and a common cause of invasive and life threatening
infections. It is the most common cause of communityassociated cellulitis [1,2] endocarditis [3], and is a common cause of bacteremia [1,4,5]. S. aureus strains were
once nearly uniformly susceptible to semi-synthetic
penicillinase-resistant β-lactams (e.g. methicillin, oxacillin), the most commonly used class of antibiotics
for skin infection. These strains were termed ‘methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a term that



implied cross-resistance to all β-lactams including all
penicillins and cephalosporins.
