**Abstract**
Background: _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 ( _E. coli_ O157:H7) is now recognized as a major cause of diarrhoea, hemorrhagic colitis and
hemolytic-uremic syndrome worldwide. Consumption of raw or undercooked meat of bovine origin has been the most common means of
transmitting this organism.
Methodology: Over a period of 7 months (October 2006 to April 2007), a total of 738 raw meat samples were collected from bovines (n=
250), sheep (n=243) and goat (n=245) and investigated for the presence of _E. coli_ O157: H7. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was
performed using the disk diffusion method.
Results: _E._ _coli_ O157:H7 were isolated from 31 (4.2%) out of 738 meat samples examined. Among meat samples examined, the highest
prevalence (8%) was recorded in beef, followed by lamb and mutton (2.5%) and goat meat (2%). The isolated strains were found to be
susceptible (100%) to amikacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, polymyxin B and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Multidrug resistance to three or more drugs was detected in 7/31 (22.6%) strains.
Conclusions: The results of this study revealed the presence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in retail raw meats reaching consumers, indicating possible
risks of infection to people through the consumption of raw/under-cooked meat or cross-contamination of other food products. Coordinated
actions are needed to reduce or eliminate the risks posed by this organism at various stages in food chain. Multiple drug resistant isolates
detected in the present study may pose a threat to humans and further limit therapeutic options.

**Introduction** use in VTEC infections is controversial because of the



_Escherichia coli_ ( _E. coli_ ) is a normal part of the
intestinal micro-flora of many healthy animals,
including humans. However, some strains can cause
diseases. Verocytotoxigenic _E. coli_ (VTEC) (also
referred to as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ ), including
serotype O157:H7, are one such group, causing severe,
chronic, and potentially fatal illness such as
hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome,
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and, in severe
cases, death, related to their ability to produce one or
more toxins known as verotoxin or Shiga-like toxin [1].
Consumption of raw or undercooked foods of bovine
origin has been the most common means of transmitting
VTEC organisms in sporadic cases and in outbreaks of
VTEC infection [2].

Nevertheless, a variety of other foods have also
been implicated in causing outbreaks [3,4]. Antibiotic



use in VTEC infections is controversial because of the
potential to increase production and secretion of Shiga
toxins [5]. However, increase in antibiotic resistance
has been noted over the last 20 years [6-8]. Outbreaks
of _E. coli_ O157 have been reported in different parts of
the world [9-11].

However, little is known about the prevalence of
this serogroup in Ethiopia, either in humans or in the
animal population or in foods [12]. The present study
was conducted to address the lack of information
pertaining to the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility
profiles of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in raw meat obtained from
food animals in Ethiopia where raw meat from these
sources is widely consumed.
