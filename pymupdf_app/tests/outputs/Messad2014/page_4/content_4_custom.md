2010b), and the environmental stresses encountered by bacteria
during the slaughter process (McMahon, Xu, Moore, Blair, &
McDowell, 2007) may also play a role in the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance.
21.7% of isolated strains were resistant to erythromycin, this
resistance remains low in industrialized countries, however,
resistant strains are frequently observed in developing countries,
including Thailand (50%) and Zimbabwe (14%) (WHO, 2003). In
another way, Lin et al. (2007) showed that erythromycin used in
low doses over a long period (which corresponds to their use as a
growth factor) selects for resistant strains of Campylobacter.
83.7% of isolated strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Several
studies have demonstrated the rapid development of mutants
resistant to fluoroquinolones in chickens infected with initially
fluoroquinolones susceptible Campylobacter, and treated with
enrofloxacin. Indeed, treatments of chickens do not eradicate the
organism but convert initially susceptible population to resistant
fluoroquinolones population which emerges as soon as 24 h from
start of treatment (Farnell et al., 2005; Han, Sahin, Barton, & Zhang,
2008; McDermott, Bodeis, & English, 2002; ).
The resistance to tetracycline was very frequent (83.7%) as reported by other authors (Bester & Essack, 2008; Mansouri-najand,
Saleha, & Wai, 2012; Tambur, Miljkovic-Selimovic, Doder, & Kulisic, 2010).

In Malaysia, resistance rates were higher than our results; 86%
was recorded to ampicillin, 82% to ciprofloxacin, 92% to tetracycline
and 99% to erythromycin and even with gentamicin (35%) (Tang,
Mohamad Ghazali, Saleha, Nishibuchi, & Son, 2009).
Roughly, Vandeplas et al. (2008) believe that changes in rates of
antimicrobial resistance between countries reflect various veterinary practices in antimicrobial use for treatment and prevention.
All our isolates were multi-drug resistant; we had identified a
dominant profile combining resistance to two beta-lactams, two
quinolones and tetracycline. In Belgium, the National Reference Laboratoryforfoodbornediseaseandantimicrobialresistanceofzoonotic
agents, announced that the percentages of strains multi-drug resistant of C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from chickens were 40% and 64%
respectively, the dominant profile was “nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin,
tetracycline” (Dierick, Botteldoorn, Denayer, & Naranjo, 2009).
15% of strains isolated in our study were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. These strains represent a critical
profiles, since these two antibiotics are the mostly used in
Campylobacter infections in humans (Engberg, Aarestrup, GernerSmidt, & Nachamkin, 2001; Luangtongkum et al. 2009). In addition to clinical troubles, transmission of multi-resistant Campylobacter to humans through food chain can also compromise the
effectiveness of treatment. Indeed, the EFSA has published a report
indicating that antimicrobial resistance phenomenon occurs in
most common zoonosis bacteria, particularly Campylobacter from
animals and food in the European Union (EFSA, 2010b).


5. Conclusion


Unlike other foodborne pathogens, Campylobacter are very susceptible to many environmental conditions, as concluded in this
survey, our results confirm that Campylobacter can survive well from
poultry farms to the plate of consumer and are of concern of food
poisoning. Indeed, intestinal carriage and neck skins contamination
rates in the present study showed high survival of Campylobacter in
farms, in slaughterhouses and carcasses. It revealed that antibiotic
resistant Campylobacter is common among chickens which can find
their way into the food chain. The recorded multi-drug resistant
campylobacters which was also reported to be common in other
countries reflect an alarming situation with regard to this phenomenonwhich may bedue tothewidespread use of antibioticsinpoultry
farming. As major source of human campylobacteriosis, prevention
should be focused on reducing Campylobacter infection at all stages of
poultry production chain, as well as for the controlling use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine in Algeria. Thus, there is an urgent
need for prudent use ofantibiotics inpoultry production to reduce the
development and spread of multi-drug resistant Campylobacter
which must be diligently monitored. Our results also emphasize the
