It has been reported that all chickens are infected one week after introduction of bacteria in poultry building (Shreeve, Toszeghy, Pattison, & Newell, 2000). Chickens are coprophagous and fecal excretion is probably an important factor in spread of microbes in poultry flocks (Usha et al., 2010). This result can also be related to high animal density, which promotes contact between animals especially those carrying Campylobacter (Megraud & Bultel, 2004). In addition to sources such as soiled litter, untreated water, other farm animals, wild birds, insects, as well as the human flow, Viable Non-Cultivable forms were associated with Campylobacter transmission in broilers, which would in turn be responsible for transmission of these microorganisms to the environment (Humphrey, O'Brien, & Madsen, 2007).",
