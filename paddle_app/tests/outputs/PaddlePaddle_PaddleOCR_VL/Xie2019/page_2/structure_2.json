For example, S. enterica serotype Typhimurium, which can cause various symptoms include diarrheal disease (Andrews & Ryan, 2015; El-Tayeb, Ibrahim, Al-Salamah, Almaary, & Elbadawi, 2017). Molecular subtyping of Salmonella is effective for epidemiological investigations of infections and outbreaks. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a good method based on sequence analysis of some housekeeping genes. Given its high repeatability in globally dispersed laboratories, MLST is becoming an important method in the investigation of various pathogens including Salmonella (Yang et al., 2015). Researchers have found that many bacteria contain conserved repetitive intergenic consensus sequences, which have proven to be useful for subtyping pathogens. As a PCR-based fingerprinting technique, ERIC-PCR is easy, fast, and relatively cheap (Li, Liu, Li, Xu, & Zheng, 2017).",
