consumption. Sausages usually are only lightly cooked by
frying when served for breakfast or by grilling when served at
popular social gatherings such as barbecues. Although
Salmonella is known to be heat labile, when deeply embedded
in sausages the pathogen may be insulated from heat treatment
and thus remain viable for causing disease.

The International Commission on Microbiological
Specifications for Foods and the European Union have a
zero tolerance limit for Salmonella in food (9). Thus,
detection of Salmonella contamination in food is an
essential quality control practice of food manufacturers
and processors. Rapid identification methods for the
detection of foodborne bacterial pathogens have become
an important aspect of the food industry. However, these
new methods must be rigorously examined for their
applicability in diverse and unique food matrices before
they can be routinely accepted. In line with global trends,
modern animal husbandry in Botswana has increased the
use of antimicrobials for both disease therapy and as
prophylactics to prevent the onset of infectious diseases and
enhance growth. This increased use has resulted in a rise in
the number of antimicrobial resistant pathogens (1), which
poses a major public health problem because these resistant
strains can spread from their animal reservoirs to humans,
hence decreasing the number of antimicrobials that are
effective for treating human infections.

The aim of this study was to provide data on the
prevalence of Salmonella in different types of raw meat
sausages directly accessible to consumers in Botswana. The
reliability of a rapid PCR method designed for detection of
Salmonella in foods (4) also was evaluated. The Salmonella
isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing
using a wider array of antibiotics than has been used
previously in studies in Botswana.


MATERIALS AND METHODS


Sample collection. A total of 300 raw meat sausages were
collected from various retail outlets (supermarkets and butcheries)
in Gaborone, Botswana, from January 2008 to March 2009. The
samples were transported to the laboratory in a cooler box with ice
packs. Sausages were collected at 3-day interval to avoid sampling
from the same consignment. Four types of raw meat sausages were
analyzed: beef (79 sausages), pork (78), chicken (72), and mutton
(71). Analysis of the samples was carried out immediately (2 to 3 h)
after collection.


Sample dilution. For each sample, a representative subsample (approximately 25 g) was aseptically removed with a pair of
scissors and forceps. This subsample was homogenized with
225 ml of buffered peptone water (C 134, Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) in a Stomacher 400 lab blender (Seward, London, UK)
for 60 s to make a 10 [2][1] dilution. Further 10-fold dilutions were
made as necessary.


Enumeration of aerobic mesophilic bacteria in samples.
To determine the microbiological quality of the meat types, 1 ml of
sample was removed from the 10 [2][1] dilution of and further diluted
up to 10 [2][6] . One milliliter from the 10 [2][4] to 10 [2][6] dilutions was put
into separate duplicate sterile 9-cm-diameter petri dishes. Plate
count agar (CM 325, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) was cooled to 45 ¡
1uC, and 10 to 15 ml was added and swirled to thoroughly and



uniformly mix the sample and medium. When the medium had
solidified, the plates were inverted and incubated for 48 ¡ 2 h at
35 ¡ 1uC.


Enrichment of salmonellae from sausages by conventional
culture method. The 10 [2][1] dilution was incubated at 37 ¡ 1uC for
16 to 20 h as a preenrichment step. A 0.1-ml aliquot of overnight
preenrichment broth culture was inoculated into 10 ml of Rappaport Vassiliadis (RV) broth (CM 699, Oxoid), and 1 ml was
transferred to 10 ml of mannitol selenite cystine (MSC) broth (CM
399, Oxoid). Inoculated RV broth tubes were incubated at 42
¡1uC for 18 to 24 h, and inoculated MSC broths were incubated at

37 ¡ 1uC for 18 to 24 h.


Culturing of salmonellae on selective agar plates. After 24
¡ 3 h of incubation, all samples from the MSC and RV cultures
were inoculated onto three plates of xylose lysine desoxycholate
agar (XLD; CM 469, Oxoid) and three plates of brilliant green agar
(BGA; CM 263, Oxoid) for growth of Salmonella colonies. From
XLD plates, suspect Salmonella colonies, which were red with a
black center, were picked and further purified on fresh XLD plates.
Suspect Salmonella colonies (small gray to reddish pink)
on BGA plates were purified on fresh BGA plates, which were
incubated at 37 ¡ 1uC for 22 to 26 h. Purified colonies with
morphological characteristics similar to those of Salmonella were
then subcultured onto nutrient agar plates (CM 003, Oxoid). Genus
identity was confirmed with biochemical and serological tests.


Biochemical identification. The presumptive identification of
Salmonella colonies was carried out by stabbing the butt of triple
sugar iron (TSI) slants and then streaking the slope. The inoculated
TSI slants were incubated at 37uC and examined after 18 to 24 h for
carbohydrate fermentation, gas production, and hydrogen sulfide
production. Five individual colonies of the presumptive Salmonella
isolates from the 24-h nutrient agar plates were subjected to the
urease test by inoculation into urea broth and incubation at 37uC for
18 to 24 h. The presumptive Salmonella isolates were also identified
with the VITEK 2 (bioMe´rieux, Hazelwood, MO) automated
system. The bioMe´rieux VITEK 2 GN ID card (ref. 21341) was
used for identification. This system is based on analysis of 64
biochemical and enzymatic tests conducted in microwell plates.


Serological identification with the slide agglutination test.
Commercially prepared Salmonella antisera (Mast Assure, Davies
Diagnostics Pty. Ltd., Randburg, South Africa) was used for
serological identification. The antisera had Poly O (A through S)
and H phase 1 z 2 (a through z29) and their various monovalent
factors. The isolates were grouped by the polyvalent factors and then
further typed by the monovalent factors until the isolate was fully
identified. The serotyping of the Salmonella isolates was performed
according to the Kauffmann-White classification scheme (13).


Detection of Salmonella in sausages by PCR assay. The
salmonellae were recovered from either 1 ml of RV or MSC
selective enrichment broths by centrifuging at 5,000 rpm (Biofuge
Stratos, Heraeus Instruments, Hanau, Germany) for 2 min. The
salmonellae were washed in 1 ml of 1| phosphate-buffered saline.
The pellet was then resuspended in 200 ml of sterile distilled water,
and DNA was released by heating at 96uC for 12 to 15 min in a
water bath. The cellular debris was removed by centrifuging at
12,000 rpm for 10 min, and 5 ml of the clear supernatant containing
nucleic acids was used for subsequent PCR assays.
