The residual patterns contained two to four isolates (ten Rep-PCR patterns) or single isolates (21 Rep-PCR patterns). Cluster of the sixth profile was very diverse, intermixing isolates of different origins (hospital and several farms: A, C, D, and J), and all the clonally related isolates (determined by Rep-PCR) were of the same sequence-type defined by MLST. Three clonal groups (VI, X, and XXXI) connected chicken commensal isolates to human pathogenic ones. They belonged to phylotypes B1 and D and ST21, ST48, and ST471 (Fig. 1). One pattern (XXX) was common to chicken and chicken-farmer commensal strains (D; ST108), and another (I) was identified in a chicken-farmer commensal strain and a human pathogenic one (B1; ST19) (Fig. 1). The clustered isolates exhibited slight variations independently of their origin, year of isolation, resistance pattern, or sample nature.
