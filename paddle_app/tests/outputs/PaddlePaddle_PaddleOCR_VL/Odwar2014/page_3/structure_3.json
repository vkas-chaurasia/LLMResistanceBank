A multiplex PCR system was optimized by the progressive incorporation of primers corresponding to the different genes and several combinations of melting temperatures, primer concentrations and DNA template concentration. PuReTaq ready to go PCR beads (GE Health care) were used for PCR. The total reaction volume in each PCR tube was  $ 25 \\mu l $  containing  $ 3 \\mu l $  template DNA,  $ 2 \\mu l $  primer ( $ 0.2 \\mu l $  of each primer) and  $ 20 \\mu l $  sterile PCR water.

This was followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at  $ 94^{\\circ} $ C for 1 minute, annealing at  $ 56^{\\circ} $ C for 30 seconds and extension at  $ 72^{\\circ} $ C for 1 minute.
