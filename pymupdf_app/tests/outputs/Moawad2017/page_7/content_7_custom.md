Twenty-one _E. coli_ isolates were characterized as 4 O18
(19.0%) and 4 O78 (19.0%) serotypes. Other serotypes are
given in Table 2.


**Molecular identification of** _**Salmonella**_ **serovars**
All 15 recovered _S. enterica_ serovars harboured _omp_ C
gene, which confirms _Salmonella_ genus. Nine _S. enterica_
serovar Typhimurium (60.0%) and two _S. enterica_ serovar
Enteritidis (13.3%) were identified by means of serovarspecific bands using PCR (Table 3). Four other isolates
could not be typed with PCR method (26.7%).


**Determination of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles**
The results of determination of antimicrobial resistance
of _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ isolates to thirteen antibiotics
are given in Tables 4 and 5. Most of the _S. enterica_ isolates showed resistance to ampicillin (87.0%) and cefotaxime (80.0%) and all were susceptible to chloramphenicol,
colistin and ciprofloxacin. Resistance to other antibiotics
was shown in Table 4.
Seven isolates of _S. enterica_ serovar Typhimurium
were resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime and cefpodoxime
(77.8%), while 6 isolates (66.7%) were highly sensitive to
ciprofloxacin. Resistance to other antibiotics was weaker
developed.
Both _S. enterica_ serovar Enteritidis isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime and tetracycline. Additionally, one isolate showed resistance to streptomycin,
nalidixic acid, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and
streptomycin.



In addition to the entire resistance to ampicillin and
cefotaxime, majority of the _S. enterica_ serovar Paratyphi
A isolates were resistant to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid,
ceftriaxone and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole.
_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Kentucky isolate showed
no pronounced susceptibility to any of the tested antibiotics and was resistant to six of them (Table 4). Seven
out of 15 _S. enterica_ serovars (46.7%) revealed phenotypic
multidrug resistance exhibiting by resistance to three or
more classes of antibiotics (Table 4).
_Escherichia coli_ isolates showed resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid with
80.9, 71.4, 61.9, 61.9 and 61.9%, respectively. Ten (47.6%),
9 (42.8%) and 9 (42.8%) isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone, respectively.
All tested isolates were susceptible to colistin. Thirteen
_E. coli_ isolates (61.9%) were characterized as multidrug
resistant (Table 5).
The multidrug resistance of isolated _Salmonella_ and _E._
_coli_ was shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.


**Molecular detection of resistance‑associated genes**
Six of 8 screened resistance-associated genes were
detected in _S. enterica_ serovars by PCR (Table 6). Eleven
(73.3%) isolates harboured _bla_ CTX-M gene (1, 3 and 14)
associated with cefotaxime resistance and 11 (73.3%)
isolates harboured _bla_ TEM-1 gene associated with penicillin and narrow spectrum β-lactamase resistance. Five
(33.3%) isolates harboured quinolone resistance gene
