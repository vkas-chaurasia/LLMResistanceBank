1. Introduction



The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of Salmonella spp. in 300 beef meat samples collected from
cattle carcasses of different categories (young bulls, culled heifers and culled cows). The detection of Salmonella
spp. was performed by the alternative VIDAS Easy Salmonella technique and confirmed by PCR using Salmonella
specific primers. Salmonella serotypes were determined by slide agglutination tests. The resistance to 12 antibiotics was determined by the diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar antibiotic discs. The overall contamination
rate of beef by Salmonella spp. was 5.7% (17/300). This rate varied from naught (0/100) in bulls' meat to 14% (14/
100) in culled cows' meat (p b 0.001). The prevalence of Salmonella spp. was higher in summer and in cattle with
digestive disorders: chronic gastroenteritis (6/17), traumatic peritonitis (3/17) and intestinal obstruction (2/17)
(p b 0.0001). Of the 17 Salmonella isolates, 6 serotypes were identified, namely Salmonella Montevideo (8/17),
Salmonella Anatum (3/17), Salmonella Minnesota (2/17), Salmonella Amsterdam (2/17), Salmonella Kentucky
(1/17) and Salmonella Brandenburg (1/17) (p b 0.05). Unlike other serotypes, S. Montevideo was present during
the whole year except winter. Almost all of the strains (16/17) were resistant to at least one of the 12 tested antibiotics. Multidrug-resistance concerned 14/17 of the strains, including Amoxicillin (13/17), Tetracycline (12/
17), Streptomycin (10/17) and Nalidixic acid (6/17). All the strains were sensitive to the association
(Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid), Cefoxitin and Ceftazidime. In addition, our study showed that all Salmonella
strains (17) were positive for invasion gene invA and negative for the virulence gene spvC. Only one isolate (S.
Kentucky) harbored the h-li virulence gene.

Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease with a rising prevalence in the
cattle industry. It is frequent in calves of one to ten weeks age, but
also reported in dairy and beef cattle (Randall, Cooles, Osborn,
Piddock, & Woodward, 2004). Typical clinical signs of acute Salmonella
infection include fever associated to diarrhea. Infected animals can be
asymptomatic and shed to one billion Salmonella a day in their feces
(Millemann, 1998). Salmonellosis is a major food-borne disease worldwide (WHO, 2013). The pathogenicity of Salmonella depends essentially
on its chromosomal and/or plasmatic virulence genes (Okamoto, Filho,
& Rocha, 2009; Montero, Herrero, & Rodicio, 2012). The chromosomal
invA gene enables the invasion of epithelial cells (Galan & Curtiss,
1989). H-li gene is involved in the control of phase change and motility

of Salmonella. In addition, h-li gene is required for optimal transcription
of several genes of invasion (Millemann, 1998). The virulence plasmid
spv genes play a role in multiplication of Salmonella in its host cell
(Rotger & Casadesus, 1999), increase the severity of enteritis. It allows
both infection and persistence in extra-intestinal sites (Libby, Lesnick,
& Guiney, 2000) and under hostile conditions (Valone & Muller, 1993).
Ciprofloxacin and Cefotaxime are the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of invasive Salmonella infections in humans (Su
& Ou, 2004; Bertrand, Weill, & Vrints, 2006; Whichard, Gay, & Cooper,
2007). However, multidrug resistant Salmonella strains are becoming a
real worldwide threat (Weill, Grimont, & Cloeckaert, 2006; Bouchrif,
Ennajii, & Timinouni, 2008). Since 2002 in Europe an emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella spp. isolates has been reported in travelers returning from Northeast and Eastern Africa (Collard, Place, &
Denis, 2007). In African countries, multidrug-resistant Salmonella spp.
strains exhibiting resistance to Ciprofloxacin have been reported in several studies (Aragaw, Molla, Muckle, & Poppe, 2007; Bouchrif et al.,

2008; Molla, Berchau, & Kleer, 2006). For these reasons, food-borne diseases caused by Salmonella spp. are a significant public health concern
around the world (Sire & Garin, 2008; Marrero-Ortiz, Han, & Lynne,
2012). Non-typhoid serovars are increasing in importance as significant
pathogens of both humans and animals (Mukhopadhyay &
Ramaswamy, 2012). Indeed, there are about 17 million cases of acute
gastroenteritis or diarrhea annually due to non-typhoid salmonellosis
causing 3 million deaths (Rabsch, Tschäpe, & Baumler, 2001). Over 1
million cases of salmonellosis are attributed to consumption of contaminated foods (meat, eggs…) each year in the United States of America.
The most common serotypes associated with human diseases in the
U.S.A. are S. Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Newport, Heidelberg and Javiana
(Scallan et al., 2011). Salmonella infections lead to approximately 19,000
cases of hospitalizations and nearly 400 deaths each year in the U.S.A.
(Scallan et al., 2011), with an economic burden due to lost work, increased medical costs and deaths (Scharff, 2010). Undercooked beef is
the most involved food in gastroenteritis, after eggs and egg products
(ANSES, 2011). In France, 35% of food-borne Salmonella infections
were attributable to the consumption of undercooked beef mainly in
children under fifteen (Gauchard, Brisabois, & Espie, 2002). In Tunisia,
Salmonella food-borne infections constitute an emerging public health
problem (Ben Aissa, Troudi, & Belhadj, 2007). The most frequently isolated serotypes, in 2010, were S. Enteritidis (45%) and S. Typhimurium
(27%) (R.T.S.R.B.A, 2012). In 2011, two episodes of Salmonella foodborne infections occurred in South Tunisia following the consumption
of beef; it caused one death and more than 117 clinical cases (Hamza,
2013).



The deep contamination of meat can be related to either clinical or
asymptomatic infections (Vieria-Pinto & Tenreiro, 2012). This phenomenon is increased by the slaughtering stress, especially in the absence of
respect of water diet and the animals' rest (Radostits, Blood, &
Hinchcliff, 2000). However, surface meat contamination occurs also
during the slaughtering from the intestinal contents (Buncic & Sofos,
2012). This fecal contamination is due to poor hygiene during animal
slaughtering. There is a high risk of beef meat deep contamination by
Salmonella spp. especially in sanitary culled animals (Labadie, 1999).
The present work aimed to on the one hand estimate the prevalence
of Salmonella meat deep contamination in both healthy bulls and culled
females (heifers and cows) and on the other hand study the isolated Salmonella strains.


2. Materials and methods


2.1. Samples


The present study was carried out during the four seasons from September 2013 to August 2014; it concerned a total number of 300 beef
meat samples designated to human consumption collected in Greater
Tunis (Tunisia) from carcasses. During each season, 75 animals (25
bulls, 25 culled heifers and 25 culled cows) were sampled.
Information about age, sex, disease history and cause of culling of the
animals was collected. But, there is no information about the health care
provided to the animals in their respective farms. Bulls were healthy at
the day of slaughtering but culled females were affected by at least one

disease (chronic gastroenteritis, traumatic peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, chronic feet diseases, chronic mastitis…) (Table 1).
Disposable sterile bags were used to collect approximately 100 g of
meat from the inner parts of iliopsoas muscle. The meat surface was
sterilized and the sample was transferred to a sterile stomacher bag.
As recommended by Codex Alimentarius (1987), samples were
stored at −18 °C until used in the Laboratory of Food Microbiology National School Veterinary of Medicine, Sidi Thabet (Tunisia).


2.2. Salmonella spp. VIDAS detection


The detection of Salmonella spp. by alternative VIDAS Easy Salmonella (bioMérieux, SA Marcy l'Étoile, France) technique, was performed
in four steps: primary enrichment, selective enrichment, VIDAS and
confirmation (Cheung & Kam, 2012). Twenty five grams of meat sample
were homogenized in 225 ml of Buffered Peptone Water (Biokar Diagnostics, Beauvais, France). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for
22 h. A volume of 100 μl of media was transferred to 10 ml Salmonella
Xpress broth 2 (SX2) (bioMérieux SA, Marcy l'Étoile, France) and incubated at 41.5 °C for 24 h. One milliliter of the culture was heated for
15 min at 100 °C then cooled at room temperature. A volume of 0.5 ml
SX2 broth was transferred into a SLM array and deposited in the
VIDAS (bioMérieux SA, Marcy l'Étoile, France). Confirmation of positive
samples was performed by isolation of Salmonella from unheated SX2
broth on selective agar (XLD and SS) (Biokar Diagnostics, Beauvais,
France) and identification by urease test followed by API 20E system
test (bioMérieux SA, Marcy l'Étoile, France) according to ISO 6579,
2002 reference technique.


2.3. Serotypes of Salmonella strains


Serotypes of Salmonella isolates were determined by slide agglutination tests with specific immune sera against O, H and Vi Salmonella antigens (BioRad, Marne-La-Coquette, France) at the National Centre for
Salmonella, Shigella and Vibrio, Pasteur Institute of Tunis (Tunisia). The
interpretation of the results was performed according to the White–
Kauffmann–Le Minor scheme (Popoff, Bockemühl, & Gheesling, 2001).


2.4. Molecular study


InnuPREP DNA Mini Kit (Biometra, Les Ulis, France) was used for the
extraction of Salmonella genomic DNA from the selective enrichment
SX2 broth (bioMérieux SA, Marcy l'Étoile, France): one milliliter of
SX2 broth was centrifuged for 10 min at 7500 rpm, the pellet was
mixed with a washing solution and proteinase K (20 mg/ml). The mixture was heated at 50 °C for 10 min then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for
2 min. The pellet was washed twice and DNA was eluted by a



centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 1 min then stored at − 20 °C until
used. The molecular confirmation of Salmonella was carried out by
performing a PCR detecting a 1 kb DNA fragment (Karraouan,
Fassouane, El Ossmani, Cohen, & Bouchrif, 2010), using specific primers:
F-5′ACCACGCTCTTTCGTCTGG3′ and R-5GAACTGACTACGTAGACGCTC3′
(Abouzeed, Hariharana, Poppe, & Kibengea, 2000). The invasion gene
invA and virulence genes spvC and h-li respectively have sizes of 275,
669 and 173 bp (Karraouan et al., 2010). All Salmonella isolated strains
were tested for three invasion and virulence genes (invA, h-li and
spvC) using three specific primer sets: F-5′TATCGCCACGTTCGGGCAA3′
and R-5′TCGCACCGTCAAAGGAACC3′, F-5′AGCCTCGGCTACTGGTCTTG
3′ and R-5′CCGCAGCAAGAGTCACCTCA3′, F-5′CGGAAATACCATCAAA
TA3′ and R-5′CCCAAACCCATACTTACTCTG3′ respectively (Abouzeed
et al., 2000).
The PCR mixture consisted of 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (20 mM Tris–
HCl; pH 8.5; 50 mM KCl), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 25 μM of
each primer, 1.25 U Taq Polymerase (Vivantis, Oceanside, USA), sterile
distilled water and 2.5 μl of DNA template.
The DNA amplification was performed using the following program:
1 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles (95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C
for 20 s and 72 °C for 2 min) and a final extension at 72 °C for 4 min
(Nayak, Stewart, & Wang, 2004). Amplification was performed in a
thermocycler (Esco Swift Max Pro, Horsham PA, USA).
PCR products were electrophorized in 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ultraviolet transillumination after ethidium bromide staining.
Negative and positive controls were added for each PCR run.


2.5. Antibiotic resistance


Resistance test to 12 antibiotics was screened by the diffusion
method on Mueller-Hinton agar antibiotic discs (BioRad, Marne-LaCoquette, France). Interpretation of the results was done according to
the Clinical and Laboratory of Standards Institute criteria (CLSI, 2008).


2.6. Statistical analyses


The infection prevalence percentages were compared using Epi Info
6 (Dean et al., 2011) with Mantel Haenszel Chi-square test. Observed
differences were considered significant when the p value was lower
than 0.05 (Schwartz, 1993).


2.7. Ethics statement


The study was performed in accordance with the Memorandum of
the French General Directorate of Food No 2012-8056 March 13, 2012
on the authorization of slaughterhouses to derogate from the requirement to stun animals.

The experimental protocol was approved by the Tunisian Association of Laboratory Animal Science, Tunisia. The restraint and slaughter
of animals were monitored and carried out by trained and competent
staff, in order to minimize animals' suffering.
All the stages were realized under the responsibility and supervision
of an official sanitary veterinarian.


3. Results


3.1. Prevalence of Salmonella spp. in beef


The deep meat contamination prevalence by Salmonella spp. was
5.7% (17/300). The 17 isolates were positive to PCR using Salmonella
specific primers (Fig. 1). This rate varies from naught (0/100) for bulls'
meat to 14% (14/100) for culled cows' meat (p b 0.001). Salmonella
spp. beef meat prevalence was higher during the summer season
(13.3%; 10/75) compared to winter (1.3%; 1/75) (p b 0.05).
A total number of 6 serotypes were identified, namely S. Montevideo
(8/17), S. Anatum (3/17), S. Minnesota (2/17), S. Amsterdam (2/17), S.
Kentucky (1/17) and S. Brandenburg (1/17) (p b 0.05) (Table 1). Unlike
other serotypes, S. Montevideo was present during the whole year except winter. It showed a prevalence peak during the summer season
(6.7%; 5/75) (p b 0.05) (Fig. 1).
Digestive disorders (chronic gastroenteritis (6/17), traumatic peritonitis (3/17) and intestinal obstruction (2/17)) were significantly related
to Salmonella spp. meat contamination (p b 0.0001) (Table 1). Moreover, chronic feet diseases (4/17) and chronic mastitis (2/17) were factors for deep meat Salmonella spp. contamination.
Prevalence of Salmonella contamination was significantly higher in
culled cows' meat with digestive disorders (23.5%; 8/34) compared to
cows with chronic feet diseases (12.1%; 4/33) and cows with chronic
mastitis (6.1%; 2/33) (p b 0.001).


3.2. Prevalence of pathogenic genes and antibiotic resistance


Salmonella strains (17) were positive for invasion gene invA and negative for the virulence gene spvC. Only one isolate (S. Kentucky) serotype was positive for h-li gene (Table 1, Fig. 3).
Almost all (16/17) of the strains were resistant to at least one of the
antibiotics. Multi-resistance concerned 14/17 of the strains, including
Amoxicillin (13/17), Tetracycline (12/17), Streptomycin (10/17) and
Nalidixic acid (6/17). Furthermore, all strains were sensitive to the association (Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid), Cefoxitin and Ceftazidime
(Table 1).


4. Discussion


The results of our study showed that Salmonella spp. beef contamination rate was 5.7% (17/300). It varies from naught (0/100) in bulls'
meat to 14% (14/100) in culled cows' meat (p b 0.001). Our results
were comparable to those of Ben Jaafar, Jiridi, Fodha, and Salem
(2002) who found a prevalence of 4.2% in Tunisian beef meat catering.
This rate was lower to the results of Derouiche (2001) in Tunisia
(9.3%). This difference could be explained by the fact that Derouiche collected samples from culled cattle.

negative control; Lanes 1 to 7: positive samples (h-li, invA); A panel: h-li positive
samples; B panel: invA positive samples.


Our study revealed that the contamination prevalence of the culled
cows' meat (14%) was significantly higher than that of culled heifers
and bulls' meat (3% and 0% respectively) (p b 0.001) (Table 1). This is
likely due to the high prevalence of latent carriage in culled cows,
immunodepression in some animals, the absence of water diet and fatigue before slaughtering (Labadie, 1999).
Seasonal fluctuation of Salmonella spp. beef meat contamination
showed a significant difference between the prevalence of Salmonella
spp. during the summer season (13.3%; 10/75) and winter (1.3%; 1/
75) (p b 0.05). Our results were comparable to those of Ayaz, Ormeci,
and Oz (2010) who found a higher prevalence of Salmonella spp. in
Turkish beef meat in summer than in other seasons. In Nepal,
Maharjan, Vandana, Durga, and Poornima (2006) indicated that the seasonal prevalence of Salmonella spp. in beef meat was highest in the
months of April and May (summer season).
Of the 17 Salmonella isolates, 6 serotypes were identified, namely, S.
Montevideo (8/17), S. Anatum (3/17), S. Minnesota (2/17), S.
Amsterdam (2/17), S. Kentucky (1/17) and S. Brandenburg (1/17)
(p b 0.05) (Table 1). Seasonal distribution of Salmonella spp. serotypes
indicated that unlike other serotypes, S. Montevideo was present during
the whole year except winter and peaking during the summer season
(6.7%; 5/75) (p b 0.05) (Fig. 1). S. Montevideo is frequently isolated
from diarrhea cattle in France (AFSSA, 2006). Since 2000, S.
Montevideo was the third most frequent serotype in cattle digestive diseases in France (7%) (AFSSA, 2006). However, our results do not agree
with those of Derouiche (2001) and Ben Jaafar et al. (2002) who revealed the predominance of S. Anatum (40%) followed by S. Corvallis.
S. Montevideo rate was 6% (Derouiche, 2001) but not isolated by Ben
Jaafar et al. (2002).
Our study did not reveal the presence of the two most frequent serotypes involved in collective food poisoning namely S. Enteritidis and S.
Typhimurium. Ben Jaafar et al. (2002) showed fairly significant levels
of contamination of beef with S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium (12%)
but Derouiche (2001) indicated a low level of contamination with S.
Enteritidis (4%) but no S. Typhimurium contamination was found.
Digestive disorders (chronic gastroenteritis (6/17), traumatic peritonitis (3/17) and intestinal obstruction (2/17)) were the main cattle disease history (Table 1). This is explained by the fact that digestive tract
disturbances increase Salmonella absorption from the intestinal lumen
(Labadie, 1999).
Our study showed that all studied Salmonella strains (n = 17) were
positive for invasion gene invA and negative for spvC virulence gene.
Only one isolate (S. Kentucky) was positive for h-li gene (Table 1, Figs.
2 and 3). Our results were similar to those of Karraouan et al. (2010)
who indicated that all strains (n = 39) of Salmonella were positive for
the invasion gene invA. Several serotypes (Muenster, Newport, Corvallis, Albert, Bredeney, Hadar, Derby, Kiel, Altona and Infantis) were negative for both virulence genes spvC and h-li, while 4/8 of S. Kentucky
serotype were positive for the gene h-li. Only S. Gallinarum was positive




158 W. Oueslati et al. / Meat Science 119 (2016) 154–159



for the spvC virulence gene. Abouzeed et al. (2000) reported similar results about the invA gene in 75 Salmonella strains from turkey meat, bovine and human samples.
PCR analysis demonstrated the h-li gene in only one of the 17 isolates. Karraouan et al. (2010) showed that 18% (7/39) of strains possess
the h-li gene. The results of our study about the presence of the gene
spvC are not consistent with those of Abouzeed et al. (2000); they revealed a frequency of 28% spvC gene (21/75) among different serotypes
of Salmonella isolated from turkey meat, cattle and human disease samples. Our results were similar to those of Turki, Ouzari, and Ben Aissa
(2012) who indicated that all strains (n = 57) of S. Kentucky isolated
from different sources (animals, food and human cases) were negative
for the spvC gene.
As it was reported in several countries (France, Belgium, Slovak Republic, Morocco, and Ethiopia) (Aragaw et al., 2007; Collard et al.,
2007; Molla et al., 2006), we noticed a high multidrug-resistance rate
in Salmonella isolated from beef.
Our study indicated that almost all (16/17) of the strains were resistant to at least one of the 12 tested antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella concerned 14/17 of the strains, including Amoxicillin (13/17),
Tetracycline (12/17), Streptomycin (10/17) and Nalidixic acid (6/17).
In Tunisia, to our knowledge there is no published data on antimicrobial
use in farm animals. In Tunisian human medicine practice, an antibacterial treatment is not indicated for uncomplicated forms of Salmonella
gastroenteritis. Quinolone therapy is reserved to clinically severe cases
(Boutiba et al., 2007).
Our results are similar to those from the study of Karraouan et al.
(2010) which studied antibiotic resistance of 39 Salmonella isolates
from turkey meat in Morocco. This study showed that 82% (32/39) of
the strains were resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics,
while the multidrug-resistant strains were present in 51.3% of the samples. High percentages of resistance were observed for Sulfonamides
(64%), Tetracycline (39%), Amoxicillin (31%) and Nalidixic acid (36%).
The rates of resistance against Amoxicillin and Tetracycline were high
in Tunisian hospitals (54.5 and 40% respectively) (Boutiba et al., 2007).
Furthermore, our study showed that all the strains were sensitive to
Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid association and Cefoxitin. But, Boutiba
et al. (2007) reported a high rate of resistance against third generation
cephalosporin in Tunisian hospitals (33%). S. Kentucky was the most resistant serotype (9/12). Similar results were reported by Karraouan
et al. (2010).


5. Conclusion


Our study revealed a low prevalence of Salmonella spp. meat contamination. This rate varied from naught for bulls meat to 14% for culled
cows' meat. In addition, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. was higher in
summer and in cattle with digestive disorders. Six serotypes of Salmonella were identified; S. Montevideo was the most frequent, followed
by S. Anatum, S. Minnesota, S. Amsterdam, S. Kentucky and S. Brandenburg. Unlike other serotypes, S. Montevideo was present during the
whole year except winter. All Salmonella strains were positive for invasion gene invA and negative for spvC virulence gene. Only one (S. Kentucky) was positive for h-li gene. Almost all of the strains were
resistant to at least one antibiotic. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella concerned many serotypes, including Amoxicillin, Tetracycline, Streptomycin and Nalidixic acid. S. Kentucky was the most resistant serotype. The
association of multidrug-resistance and invasion gene in Salmonella isolates justifies the need of surveillance system for both human and animal health sectors.
