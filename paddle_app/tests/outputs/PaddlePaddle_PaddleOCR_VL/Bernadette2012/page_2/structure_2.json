However, our study in 2005 [28] showed a high prevalence (67%) of Campylobacter spp. in chickens. This situation can be explained by the fact that Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella, and many other microorganisms, out of Campylobacter, are the priorities of health authorities of Côte d'Ivoire. Therefore, survey data on the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. mainly C. jejuni and C. coli (as they are responsible for more than 98% cases of campylobacteriosis) [29] are needed. In addition, determination of antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter isolates from chickens is important.",
