Hiko _et al._ - _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 in retail raw meat products of Ethiopia


(ATCC 25922), sensitive to all antimicrobial drugs
being tested, was used as a control strain.

_Statistical analysis_

EPI-INFO Version 6 soft package (CDC, Atlanta
GA) was used for statistical analysis. Comparisons were
made using Chi-square test with Yates’ correction or
Fisher exact tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered
indicative of a statistically significant difference.

**Results**
_Prevalence of_ E. coli _O157:H7_

Out of 738 meat samples examined, 31 (4.2%) were
found to be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 (Table
2). Beef was found to be most frequently contaminated
with _E. coli_ O157:H7 (8%) when compared to the other
raw meat types examined (2-2.5%) (p<0.05). The rate
of _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolated from all meat sources was
found to be higher from butcher shops (7.8%) than from
municipality abattoirs (6.8%) and export abattoirs
(2.3%) (p<0.05).

animal, and food sources have been reported and nonsorbitol fermenting O157:H7 strains detected in this
study could potentially only represent a fraction of
potential EHEC contamination [15]. In the present
study, beef was more frequently contaminated with _E._
_coli_ O157:H7 compared to other meat samples
examined (Table 2). This percentage is high in
comparison with the prevalence of 0-5% reported
elsewhere in the world [16-19]. However, there are
reports from different parts of the world that show a
high contamination rate of beef with _E. coli_ O157:H7,
_e.g._ 14.7%-22.5% in Peru [20], 31% in Canada [21] and
90% in the USA [22].

_Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns_

The isolated strains were susceptible (100%) to
amikacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin,
nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, polymyxin B and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Table 3). Multidrug
resistance (MDR) to three or more drugs was detected
in 7/31 (22.6%) strains. Of the 7 MDR strains, 3 were
resistant to three drugs (streptomycin, tetracycline and
ampicillin), 2 were resistant to four drugs
(streptomycin, cepahlothin, tetracycline and ampicillin),
and 2 were resistant to five drugs (streptomycin,
cephlaothin, tetracycline, ampicillin and trimethoprim).

**Discussion**

EHEC strains belonging to serogroup EHEC O157
are most frequently associated with human disease [15].
However, EHEC strains of other serotypes from human,
