warm blooded animals, commensal  $ E.\ coli $  from humans and animals can cause extra intestinal infections and are a potential reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes [15]. These bacterial strains, especially when they carry mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, transposons and integrons, can play important roles in the dissemination of transmissible resistance genes [16].

Little is known about the factors contributing to the problem of antibiotic resistance in Nigeria. This is partly because there is a dearth of information on the types, quantity and frequency of antibiotics used in farm animal production system in Nigeria. Very little is also known about the antibiotic resistance profile of bacteria (such as  $ E.\ coli $ ) commonly associated with

animal production systems in Nigeria despite the growing global concern about the transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria through the food animal production chain. The few studies that have investigated antibiotic resistance in  $ E.\ coli $  from the poultry production system in Nigeria stopped at phenotypic level without a corresponding investigation of the molecular mechanisms of resistance [17]. Yet such studies are warranted because of the potentials of  $ E.\ coli $  as reservoirs of transferable antibiotic resistance genes that could be disseminated into human populations as a result of the contact with animal wastes. This study therefore investigated antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular mechanisms of resistance in  $ E.\ coli $  isolated from eight poultry
