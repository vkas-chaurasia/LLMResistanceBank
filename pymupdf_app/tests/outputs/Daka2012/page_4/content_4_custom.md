bacteria in milk relates to poor hygiene practices. Based
on observations made during the collection of samples,
we therefore report that improper hygiene and poor
farm management practices contributed to the presence
of S. aureus in the milk, especially in those from the
Hawassa area. In this study area milk was obtained from
animals by washing their hands and/or the utensils and
containers used. In certain cases, untreated groundwater
was used to wash the containers that were used for milking. This may have contributed to the high level of S.
aureus isolated. Improving the hygienic conditions of
the milking environment and/or utensils may reduce the
prevalence of S. aureus in milk and prevent its transmission to humans.
A further objective of the study was to characterize
and compare the antibiotic-resistance profiles of S. aureus
isolated from the study area. The motivation for this was
the fact that there were no clear studies conducted in the
area. Furthermore, the presence of antibiotic-resistant
S. aureus has been reported to negatively affect the

dividing the number of a particular phenotype by the total number of
multiple antibiotic resistant isolates identified in a given area. VA, Vancomycin;

treatment of its associated infections in humans and
animals [12,15,23]. We therefore believe that an investigation of the antibiotic-resistance profiles of these
isolates may serve as a tool in assessing both the
sanitary conditions employed during milking and the
health risks that humans may encounter when infected
by antibiotic-resistant strains.
PG (10 μg), AP (10 μg) and Ox (1 μg) were the drugs
to which a large proportion of the isolates were resistant
(Table 4). As shown in Table 4, between 60.0% and
67.9% of the isolates from all CCP levels were resistant
to these three drugs. Also VA (30 μg), AC (30 μg), E
(15 μg) and CRO (30 μg) were resistance to S. aureus
about 38.5%, 32.1%, 30.8% and 23.5% respectively. None
of the S. aureus were resistance to CIP (5 μg). However,
very small proportions of S. aureus were resistance to
TMP-SMX (25 μg) (7.7%). Contrarily to our observations,
a study reported that larger percentage (15.7% to 19%) of
S. aureus isolated was resistant to TMP-SMX (25 μg)

[28]. The finding that a large number of S. aureus were
resistant to PG (10 μg), AP (10 μg) and Ox (1 μg) is, however, a cause for concern and should be further investigated. It is thus our view that the results obtained in this
study do not accurately reflect the usage of this antibiotic
on farms. We cannot explain this phenomenon.
CIP (5 μg) resistance was almost non-existent in the all
CCP levels of the isolates. Also no resistance S. aureus
strain was isolated from immediate pasteurized milk for
AC (30 μg), E (15 μg), CRO (30 μg), TMP-SMX (25 μg)
and CIP (5 μg). Despite the fact that a significantly larger
