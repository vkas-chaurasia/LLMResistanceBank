**DISCUSSION**
Although transduction of the antibiotic resistance island in _Sal-_
_monella enterica_ serovar Typhimurium phage type DT104 has
been effectively shown (28), until very recently, transduction via
bacteriophages was assumed to play a minor part in the horizontal
transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes (12, 15). Food of animal
origin is a well-known vehicle allowing the transfer of bacteria
from food-producing animals to humans, as reflected by the increasing incidence of foodborne zoonotic diseases in humans and
the rising numbers of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria found on
food of animal origin. Such food thus represents a possible source
of antimicrobial resistance in the human environment and is included in many antimicrobial screening programs. The increasing
numbers of resistant bacteria, both commensals and foodborne
pathogens, on food are a cause of concern to public health authorities, veterinarians, and physicians. Strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance have enjoyed only limited success, and there are
still many questions relating to how and when resistance transfer
occurs. The presence of phages that transfer antimicrobial resistance could explain the failures to combat antimicrobial resistance
described above. We now show, based on mathematical modeling,
that chicken meat can carry a considerable number of phages capable of transferring antimicrobial resistance and that certain antimicrobial resistance genes may be transferred primarily by
phages. We tested randomly selected coliphages from chicken
meat samples for their ability to transduce resistance to tetracycline (an antimicrobial widely used in veterinary medicine, in
aquaculture, and on plants and thus extensively released into the
environment, although its photodegradation is fairly rapid), ampicillin (a �-lactam antibiotic and, thus, a compound typical of a
range of compounds that are important in veterinary and human
medicine and that have a very short half-life in the environment),
chloramphenicol (which is banned in veterinary medicine but
which is still found in the environment), and kanamycin (an aminoglycoside which is commonly used as a second-choice antibiotic in human medicine and which can be found in aquatic environments because of its long degradation time) (29, 30). About a
quarter of the randomly selected phages were able to transduce
resistance to one or more of these antimicrobials to _E. coli_ ATCC
13706. Thus, the actual number of phages found on chicken meat
able to transduce antibiotic resistance genes must be much higher,
as we tested for resistance to only five different antibiotics and
randomly chose only five phages per sample (from a plate with 10
to 300 plaques). Accordingly, our results confirm speculations
that transduction may have a role in the exchange of antimicrobial



resistance between microorganisms and, thus, between environments (17, 31–34). Chicken meat has been reported to harbor a
high number of resistant _E. coli_ isolates (63% of _E. coli_ strains
randomly isolated from chicken meat in Austria were resistant)
(7). Resistance to tetracycline has been described to be the most
prevalent. In this study, we detected tetracycline resistance-transducing phages in three different types of chicken meat samples (a
total of 50 samples).
By means of a mathematical model (16) of the transfer of resistance to _E. coli_ by transduction in the gut of cattle, it has been
estimated that transduction is on the order of 1,000-fold less efficient than bacterial conjugation at transferring genes (16). It is
thus not surprising that resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin,
which are the antimicrobials to which _E. coli_ strains isolated from
food are the most frequently resistant (27, 35–38), is not significantly associated with phages that transfer resistance. Thus, phage
transduction may not be the major mechanism for tetracycline
resistance transfer to _E. coli_ strains found on chicken meat. In
contrast, phages that transfer kanamycin resistance were more
frequently recovered and were significantly associated with the
presence of resistant _E. coli_ isolates in the samples that we investigated. These findings indicate not only that phages appear to represent a substantial reservoir of antimicrobial resistance transfer
but also demonstrate that different mechanisms of resistance depend on different transfer strategies. Although kanamycin-resistant _E. coli_ isolates are not common in food of animal origin (7,
35), our data show, for the first time, that phage transduction
might be a major mechanism for transferring this resistance trait.
Although the elements used to transfer tetracycline and ampicillin
resistance appear to be dominated by conjugative plasmids or
transposons, phages have been shown able to transfer all types of
resistance tested, except that associated with ESBL production.
ESBL-producing _E. coli_ strains can be found on chicken meat, but
data suggest that clonal dissemination is the most prevalent means
(39). The resistance genes transduced to _E. coli_ were those most
commonly found [ _aphA1_, _bla_ TEM, _floR_, and _tet_ (A)] in these bacteria on chicken meat (27, 36–38). As an example, one gene found
to be transduced and to deliver chloramphenicol resistance is the
_E. coli floR_ gene, which is almost identical to the _floR_ gene of
_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhimurium phage type DT104 and
is located in the antimicrobial resistance island flanked by two
class 1 integrons.
Recently, lytic phages have been used in phage therapy for the
treatment of colibacillosis caused by multiresistant chickenpathogenic _E. coli_ strains (40) or for reducing _Campylobacter_ loads
in chickens (41). Considering our results, there could possibly be
a risk of transduction of antibiotic resistance genes by these
phages. Testing the transduction ability of these therapeutic
phages could be a tool for avoiding the transduction of antibiotic
resistance by these phages.
Phages differ from their bacterial hosts in a number of important properties, such as their ability to persist in the presence of
disinfectants (42, 43). Thus, disinfectants used to kill bacteria are,
in many cases, not able to eliminate bacteriophages. Some phages
are highly resistant to sodium hypochlorite at the concentrations
used in the food industry, and this disinfectant does not eliminate
or reduce the numbers of most bacteriophages (42). Alcoholic
solutions, such as 70% ethanol, have been reported to be unable to
harm most bacteriophages (42, 43). It appears that only peracetic
acid is a reliable disinfectant for most bacteriophages (42), but at
