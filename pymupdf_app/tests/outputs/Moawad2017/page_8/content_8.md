A ( _qnr_ A), while 3 (20.0%), 2 (13.3%) and 1 (6.7%) of _S._
_enterica_ serovars possessed _qnr_ B, _bla_ CMY and _qnr_ S genes,
respectively. _bla_ OXA associated with resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and _bla_ SHV associated with plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance were not found in
any isolate.
In _E. coli_ isolates, 5 of 8 screened resistance-associated
genes were detected by PCR (Table 7). Eleven (52.4%) out
of 21 isolates harboured _bla_ TEM (1 and 104), while _bla_ CTX
M [ (1 and 14) was detected in 9 isolates (42.9%). Seven iso-]
lates (33.3%) carried _qnr_ A and _qnr_ B and in three isolates
(14.3%) _bla_ OXA-1 was detected. Genes _bla_ CMY, _bla_ SHV and
_qnr_ S were not detected in any of the _E. coli_ isolates.
Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene _mcr_ -1 and
carbapenemase resistance gene _bla_ OXA-23 were not
identified neither in _S. enterica_ nor in _E. coli_ isolates
using PCR assay.


**Integron gene cassettes and DNA sequencing**
Class 1 integron was detected in two isolates of _S._ Typhimurium using PCR (Table 6). The inserted gene cassettes



identified three types of antimicrobial resistance genes
associated with class 1 integron: dihydrofolate reductase types ( _dfr_ A15 and _dfr_ A17) which confer resistance
to trimethoprim, and aminoglycoside adenyltransferase
type _aad_ A2 that confers resistance to streptomycin and
spectinomycin.
Three _E. coli_ isolates of serotypes O18, O78 and O78
were harbouring class 1 integron (Table 7). The inserted
gene cassettes identified three types of class 1 integron.
The identified antimicrobial resistance genes were dihydrofolate reductase types; _dfr_ A1, _dfr_ A15 and _dfr_ A1-orf
which confer resistance to trimethoprim.
All _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ isolates were negative for class
2 integrons.


**Discussion**
Salmonellosis and _Salmonella_ infections considered as
critical threats to human and animal health. In this study,
the prevalence of _S. enterica_ serovars in chicken and
beef meat was 8.3%, which was considerably lower than
incidence rates that reported in Ethiopia (12.0% in raw
