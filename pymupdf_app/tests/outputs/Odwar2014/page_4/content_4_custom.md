retail outlets (χ [2] n-1 = 4.178; d.f = 4; p = 0.382). However,
samples from supermarkets had the highest prevalence
(84.6%) while samples from outlets in low income areas
had the lowest prevalence of antimicrobial resistance
(62.5%).


Prevalence of E. coli isolates harboring virulence markers
Of the E. coli isolated from raw retail chicken meat,
40.4% carried at least one of 10 virulence genes tested
and specific for 5 known diarrheagenic E. coli. Of the E.
coli positive for virulence genes in this study, ETEC was
the most common pathogenic E. coli (61%) while the
least common was EAggEC (5%) (Table 4).


Conclusion
The E. coli contamination rate observed in this study
was almost similar to that observed in studies conducted
in other developing countries. For instance, contamination rates of 98% were observed in the north east part
of India, 100% in Cameroon and 100% in Vietnam

[28-30]. Similar high recovery rates have been observed
in studies from developed countries with contamination
rates as high as 100% in Japan, 89% Minnesota, U.S.A,



and 90% in two states in Australia [31-34]. Similarly,
studies in Hanoi, Vietnam, Morocco and some states in
America have shown that the percentage of retail chicken
samples which fall under the unacceptable food safety
range were also high and that perishable produce items,
including poultry, available in markets in low-socio economic status census tracts had higher microbial indicator
counts compared to markets in high-socio economic
status due to a higher prevalence of food safety violations

[30,35-37,16,17]. The results observed in this study might
be due to factors common in Nairobi such as home
slaughter of chicken by small scale poultry producers
instead of slaughter at private or municipal government
approved chicken slaughter houses thus increasing the
potential risks for contamination due to bio-security flaws

[13]. All samples from supermarkets and a majority of
samples from high income butcheries were products of
government approved private chicken slaughter houses.
Majority of carcasses in Nairobi tend to be lumped
together in one large container or sack as they are being
transported in ambient temperature thus exposing them
to the open air as well as allowing transfer of contaminants
from one carcass to another and subsequent microbial
