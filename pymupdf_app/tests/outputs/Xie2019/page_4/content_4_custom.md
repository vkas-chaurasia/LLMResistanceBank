**3.4** | **Molecular diversity patterns**


After the seven housekeeping gene sequences were uploaded,

the alleles were numbered and the isolates were assigned to 37

sequence types (STs) according to the _Salmonella_ database. The

numbers of each MLST locus were _aroC_ : 29, _dnaN_ : 27, _hemD_ : 22,

_hisD_ : 28, _purE_ : 24, _sucA_ : 25, and _thrA_ : 29. A minimum evolution tree

was constructed using the concatenated sequences of each allele,

as shown in Figure 2. The MLST results grouped the _Salmonella_ iso
lates into three clusters. ST3315 (SalE28) formed its own cluster,

which was widely separated from the others on the evolutionary

tree.

The results of ERIC‐PCR analysis of the _Salmonella_ isolates are

shown in Figure 3. We found bands ranging in size from 100 bp to

about 5,000 bp. The ERIC‐PCR patterns revealed that our isolates

could be divided into five clusters (A, B, C, D, and E) with a rela
tive similarity coefficient of 0.65. Analysis of the ERIC‐PCR found

the isolates to be very diverse genetically. Meanwhile, the isolates

belonging to clusters A and B were similar to the cluster in MLST typ
ing, including SalE7, 9, 29, and 37. However, there was no evidence



showing a relationship between source, serotype, and antibiotic

resistance.


**4** | **DISCUSSION**


Eggs were an important host of _S. enterica_ . In the United States

alone, eggs were responsible for 80% of the 371 known _Salmonella_

food poisoning cases from 1985 to 1999. In 2010, more than 2,000

people in the United States contracted food poisoning from consum
ing eggs contaminated with _Salmonella_ . This led to the recall of more

than 550 million eggs and resulted in heavy economic losses (Al,

2004). In China, about 70% of bacterial food poisoning is caused by

_Salmonella_, with eggs and egg products accounting for 90% of these

(Wu, Qin, Shi, & Zheng, 2004). Our data found that 7.6% and 3.2%

of farm and market egg samples were contaminated with _Salmonella_,

respectively. The market eggs may have a lower positive rate due to

stricter access rules. The results were also much lower than contami
nation pork (41.8%) and other meats (Capuano, Mancusi, Capparelli,

Esposito, & Proroga, 2013). For the egg samples, the contamination
