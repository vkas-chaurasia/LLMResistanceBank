**Results**
_Antimicrobial susceptibility_

Tables 2 and 3 showed the distribution of MICs
and phenotypic patterns of resistance among the
isolates. Resistance to tetracycline (81%),
sulphamethoxazole (67%), streptomycin (56%),
trimethoprim (47%), ciprofloxacin (42%) and
ampicillin (36%) was the most commonly detected
among the isolates tested while phenotypic resistance
to spectinomycin (28%), nalidixic acid (25%),
chloramphenicol (22%), neomycin (14%) and
gentamicin (8%) was less commonly detected. In
contrast, all the isolates were sensitive to amoxicillinclavulanate, ceftiofur, cefotaxime, colistin, florfenicol
and apramycin. Among the 15 ciprofloxacin resistant
isolates, eight isolates had MICs to nalidixic acid ≤ 32
mg/L. While this study was not designed to investigate
the relationship between antibiotic use and resistance
on the study farms due primarily to the nonavailability of antibiotic-use information as mentioned
earlier, it is important to report that tetracycline,
streptomycin, sulphonamides, and ampicillin are
among the antimicrobials used on all the study farms.

Among isolates of the present study, resistance to
two or more antibiotics was detected in 30 of 36 (83%)
isolates. When looking at isolates from poultry
droppings/litter, swine waste, soil (including fish pond
sediment) and well water, 93% (14/15), 63% (5/8),
89% (8/9) and 75% (3/4) of the isolates respectively
showed resistance to two or more antimicrobials. Four
isolates from pig manure (EC137, EC146), farm soil
(EC162) and well water (EC116) were fully
susceptible to all antimicrobials tested (Table 3).


_Mechanisms of resistance_

Table 3 showed the phenotypic patterns of
resistance and resistance genes profiles of the isolates.
Among the 36 isolates tested, six (17%) carried class 2
integrons, five (17%) of 24 sulphamethoxazole
resistant isolates carried class 1 integrons, while only
one isolate (3%) (EC3) carried both classes of
integrons. The variable region of the class 1 integrons



of one representative isolate (EC117) selected from
among the most common sized amplicon (1500 bp
found in four isolates) was partially sequenced (935
bp). The partial sequence showed 99% sequence
identity with position 695 to 1629 containing _aadA5_ in
_E. coli_ GL1 (GenBank accession number FJ807902).
As expected the sulphonamide resistance gene _sul1_
was detected in all class 1 integron-positive isolates as
part of the integron. The variable regions of the class 2
integrons detected among the _int2_ positive isolates
showed three different sized PCR products. The
product of one representative isolate (EC3, EC111 and
EC113) for each type was sequenced. The partial
sequences showed 88% identity with position 1057 to
436 of _E. coli_ encoding a _sat1_ (GenBank accession
number X56815) for isolate EC111, 100% identity
with position 2073 to 2608 of _E. coli_ encoding a
_dfrA1_ - _sat2_ (partial) (GenBank accession number
HM439239) for EC113 and 100% identity with
position 1995 to 2668 of _E. coli_ encoding a _sat2_
(GenBank accession number AY183453) for isolate
EC3.

In addition to _sul1_ carried as part of _int1, sul2_ and
_sul3_ were detected in 16 (67%) and 4 (17%) of 24
sulphamethoxazole – resistant isolates. All the isolates
positive for _sul3_ were from poultry waste or farm soil
from Ogbomoso. Three of the _int1_ / _sul1_ positive
isolates were also positive for _sul2._ However,
_sul2/sul3_ and _sul1/sul3_ combinations could not be
detected in any of the isolates. Of 23 strains with
phenotypic resistance to streptomycin, spectinomycin,
or a combination of both antibiotics, _aadA, strA_ and
_strB_ encoding resistance to spectinomycin /
streptomycin were detected in 15 (65%) (including
two isolates, EC123 and EC226 with intermediate
resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin), 16
(70%) and 14 (61%) isolates respectively. Five of
these isolates were positive for the _aadA/strA/strB_
combination while _strA_ was found to occur together
with _strB_ in all 14 isolates positive for _strB_ . Further,
12 (86%) of 14 isolates carrying the _strA/strB_
combination were also positive for _sul2._

The only tested ampicillin resistance gene _bla-TEM_
was found in 11 (85%) of 13 ampicillin-resistant
isolates in the present study. The highest prevalence (7
of 8 ampicillin resistant isolates) of this gene was
found among isolates from Ogbomoso. _catA1_ and
_cmlA1_ was detected in 2 (25%) and 1 (13%) of eight
chloramphenicol resistant isolates respectively.
