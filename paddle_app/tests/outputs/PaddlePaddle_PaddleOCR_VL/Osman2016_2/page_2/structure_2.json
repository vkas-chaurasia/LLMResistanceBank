The aftermath of this operation varies considerably globally as a result of the interaction between human (social structure) and animal demography (species, distribution, and density), farming systems, contaminated water sources, socio-economic strategies (manufacturing, commerce, availability of food, and animal fitness), and nation and world-wide trade. Although antibiotic use in food animals has been concealed from the public scene yet, antibiotic application in meat producing animals have impacted on public health and has left no room for confusion after being scientifically documented (Conniff, 2015). In 2010, an announcement having a public consequential impact was made public by the FDA to the world in that 28.7 million pounds of antibiotics, which comprises 80% of the total amount of antibiotics utilized in the USA, were being poured down in the animal production industry not to medical care and that currently, two million people are annually sickened by resistant bacterial infections and that 23,000 die annually according to the CDC (Conniff, 2015).",

The isolation universality of multidrug-resistant staphylococci from meat samples has been perceived by several researchers (Santos-Sanches et al., 2000; Khan et al., 2005; Huber et al., 2011; Bhargava and Zhang, 2014; Chajekca-Wierzchowska et al., 2015; Guran and Kahya, 2015). This should be taken seriously, especially when the finding of Waters et al. (2011) documents that, close to 50 percent of meat samples tested from U.S. grocery stores are contaminated with the bacteria S. aureus and resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus (MRSA), which is linked to a wide range of human diseases (Köck et al., 2010; Fätkenheuer and Kaasch, 2014; Yaw et al., 2014), is notorious for its related-Nous to food contamination and its potentiality for its transmission to humans prevails. The pre-eminent disquiet in the European Union, has become the prevention and control of MRSA being ascertained as the most public health problem (Köck et al., 2010), an act that should be implemented in Egypt. Also, the high prevalence of MR-CNS found in livestock production (Huber et al., 2011) becomes a relevant consternation in view of the dispersing potentiality of mecA to MRSA as several coagulase negative staphylococcus (CNS) species, which are also non-S. aureus (NSA), can serve as reservoirs for mecA (Bhargava and Zhang, 2014). This consigned multiresistant CNS-NSA strains the intuitive capability to develop into an emerging problem for veterinary medicine.",
