4. Discussion


4.1. Prevalence


To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological study of
Salmonella contamination in laying-hen flocks ever carried out in
the Annaba and Eltarf regions of Algeria. Prior to this research, very
little information was available on Salmonella prevalence in Algerian
poultry farms. Although the study by Elgroud et al. (2009) and the
present study are not strictly comparable in terms of breeding type,
housing system and methodology of sampling, it might be worth
pointing out that the prevalence estimated by Elgroud et al. (2009)
emphasizes quite a high level of Salmonella contamination in Algerian
poultry farms. The results of our own study show that eight flocks
(44.4%) tested positive for Salmonella during the laying period. Within
the European Union, a baseline study conducted by EFSA between
October 2004 and September 2005 on laying-hen flocks at the end of
the rearing period showed an average prevalence of Salmonellapositive flocks of 30.8% (EFSA, 2007b). The Salmonella prevalence in
this kind of flock varied widely between member states: 17.9% in
France (Huneau-Salaün et al., 2009), 31.08% in Belgium (Namata et al.,
2008), 79% in Portugal (Hald, 2008) and 0% in Sweden and
Luxembourg (Van Hoorebeke et al., 2010).
Our results should be interpreted with caution because of the
relatively small number of sampled flocks, and because the sample
was not randomized from the Algerian laying-hen population, which
restricts comparability with research in developed countries on
Salmonella prevalence in egg-laying flocks. It should nevertheless be
emphasized that our study is practically exhaustive with respect to
these two regions, and that poultry breeding in these regions is similar
to poultry breeding nationwide. We consequently consider that our
study may be representative enough for a preliminary estimation of
the prevalence of Salmonella contamination in Algerian laying-hen
flocks. It should also be noted that the same person was responsible
for visiting all the farms and collecting all the data, which should make
data collection and interpretation more uniform.
Our results show that Salmonella prevalence was higher at the end
of the laying period than at the beginning or middle. It is well known
that the chance of detecting Salmonella in a flock increases as the hens
get older (Namata et al., 2008). It can be attributed to the fact that the
layers are physiologically stressed when reared in close confinement
in caged systems and particularly during egg production. Several
authors have reported that the stress factors such as the onset of lay,
high temperatures, induced molting, final stages of the production
period or transportation to the slaughterhouse can cause recurrences
of Salmonella excretion (Golden et al., 2008; Humphrey, 2006; Van de
Giessen et al., 2006). Furthermore, in this work, two out of three
henhouses that tested positive at the beginning of laying had been
declared positive at the end of the previous flocks' laying period. Four
Salmonella isolates were recovered from dust samples when subsequent flocks were housed in the same henhouses. It was previously
thought that dust samples can give more accurate information on the
layer house's past Salmonella status (Arnalod, Carrique-Mas, & Davies,
2009). The result of the current study clearly corroborates this finding.
The proportion of positive samples in our study is quite low—only
19, or 0.68%. Despite the relatively short transportation time and the
larger number of samples taken in our study, Salmonella was only
found in a few sampled environments. However, several studies have
shown that the intensive sampling of laying-hen environments is
regarded as an effective method for detecting Salmonella in laying-hen
flocks with a low contamination level (Aho, 1992; Carrique-Mas et al.,
2009; Musgrove & Jones, 2005). The low proportion of Salmonella in
seven pooled samples in this study may be explained by the low
degree of shedding at the time of sampling and/or the intermittent
excretion of Salmonella by infected birds (Van Immerseel et al., 2004).
Furthermore, this finding indicates that this sampling protocol



(limited to pooled feces, dust and environmental samples) used in
our study is not sufficiently sensitive in flocks where the bacterium is
only shed in very small amounts, or not shed at all. We might suppose
that in layer houses which are apparently Salmonella-negative, on the
basis of the results from the bacteriological analysis of all pooled
samples, a proportion of the hens may still carry the pathogen without
shedding it, leading to an underestimation of the actual prevalence of
Salmonella in the studied flocks. This is suggested by the data reported
by Van Hoorebeke et al. (2009), which indicate that the post-mortem
examination of hens (cecal and/or ovary/oviduct samples) is the most
accurate test to determine the infection status of laying-hen flocks
with a low Salmonella contamination level.


4.2. Serovars and antibiotic resistance


The distribution of Salmonella serovars identified in the present
study was particularly heterogeneous. Salmonella Enteritidis was the
most commonly isolated serovar in terms of number of isolates
(n=4), but it was recovered in only one henhouse. A single isolate of
Salmonella Typhimurium was recovered during our investigation.
Nationally, S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium serotypes are the most
frequently isolated from poultry samples. In a study conducted
between 1998 and 2002 by the Pasteur Institute in Algiers on 51,826
samples from all types of poultry farms including hens, eggs
and turkeys, 112 out of positive strains belonged to the serovar
S. Enteritidis (Aboun et al., 2003). In 2006, 26 confirmed outbreaks
involving Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium were reported in
northern regions of the country in different poultry farms, including
laying-hen flocks (Anonymous, 2006), and 25 confirmed outbreaks in
2008 involved Salmonella Enteritidis (Anonymous, 2009). During this
study (March 2008 to November 2009), 50 strains of S. Typhimurium
and eight strains of S. Enteritidis were recovered in human patients
from both Annaba and Eltarf regions. Unfortunately, no information is
available about the possible link between these clinical cases and egg
consumption. It is also worth mentioning that many cases may not be
reported because the ill person either does not visit a doctor or no
sample is obtained for laboratory tests. Voetsch et al. (2004) estimated
that for each laboratory-confirmed case of Salmonella, there are 38
cases that are missed through a lack of surveillance. In the European
Union, S. Enteritidis was the most commonly reported serovar in 2008
(58.0% of all confirmed cases), followed by Salmonella Typhimurium
(21.9%) (EFSA, 2010). The number of S. Enteritidis cases is tending
to decrease in EU member states, increasing the relative proportion of
S. Typhimurium cases.
In our research project, Salmonella Kentucky was recovered from
three different laying-hen flocks, two isolates of S. Manhattan and one
isolate of S. Albany were found in a single flock respectively. The
serotypes S. Kentucky, S. Manhattan, and S. Albany are not usually
isolated from poultry samples in Algeria. These isolates may have
been acquired from the environment or animals' sources indicating
the diversity of the potential reservoirs of nontyphoidal Salmonella.
Unfortunately, no investigations have been conducted to identify the
origin of contamination. A single strain of Salmonella Dublin was
isolated once in a water sample in our study. This serotype is rarely
encountered in poultry, and more frequently associated with bovine
production. Its presence may be the consequence of the presence of
other animals on the farm and the absence of precautionary measures
by farm staff. Serovar diversity could suggest a plethora of sources: the
environment, feed, water, easy access to other animal species, carried
by farm workers and more.
In this study, the number of isolates resistant to at least three
antimicrobials is relatively small and could indicate that the use of
antibiotics in laying-hen flocks remains moderate. None of the flocks
was treated with antimicrobials according to farmers' statements. The
overall limited antimicrobial usage in egg-producing laying hens in
our study is in accordance with previous studies on laying hens
