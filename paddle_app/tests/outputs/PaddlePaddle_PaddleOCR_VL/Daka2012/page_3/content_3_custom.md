(MAR) phenotypes were recorded for isolates showing resistance to three and more antibiotics  $ [25] $ .

## Results

### Prevalence of S. aureus in tested milk samples

A total of 160 milk samples (32 per HACCP level) were analyzed and were 78 positive for S. aureus (Table 1). A total of 210 potential isolates were sub-cultured and further analyzed. However, only 78 isolates satisfied all the identification criteria and were used for subsequent analysis. These constituted a total of 78 S. aureus isolates (Table 1). S. aureus was obtained from each of the 32 different critical control point (CCP) samples taken per HACCP level, giving a prevalence of S. aureus of 48.75% for the 160 samples. The results demonstrated the presence of S. aureus in all the milk samples, regardless of the farm setting. However, the levels of contamination with S. aureus were higher in milk samples obtained in this study area (Table 1).

## Antibiotic susceptibility

All 78 S. aureus isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility tests. Nine antimicrobial agents, from different antibiotic classes were used. Some were selected because some studies have shown that large numbers of bacteria were resistant to them [22,23]. Antibiotics of veterinary and human health relevance were also considered. A summary of the percentage of S. aureus that were resistant to these antibiotics is provided in Table 2.

A large proportion of the isolates of this study area were resistant to Ampicillin (10  $ \mu $ g), Penicillin G (10  $ \mu $ g), and Oxacillin (1  $ \mu $ g), while a similarly large proportion of those from the transportation container were resistant to, Ampicillin (10  $ \mu $ g), penicillin G (10  $ \mu $ g), Erythromycin (15  $ \mu $ g), Ceftriaxone (10  $ \mu $ g), Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid

(30  $ \mu $ g), and Oxacillin (1  $ \mu $ g). There were no resistant groups for Ciprofloxacin (5  $ \mu $ g) antibiotics.

In general observation the large percentage of Penicillin G (10  $ \mu $ g), Ampicillin (10  $ \mu $ g) and Oxacillin (1  $ \mu $ g) resistant S. aureus were isolated from the study area. These were also resistant to several other antibiotics. Therefore, one can easily conclude that these are Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

Only a small proportion of the isolates from the teat, bucket and storage container were resistant to Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (25  $ \mu $ g); Erythromycin (15  $ \mu $ g); Ceftriaxone (30  $ \mu $ g) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid (30  $ \mu $ g). None of the isolates from bucket, storage container and freshly pasteurized milk were resistant to TMP-SMX (25  $ \mu $ g). Furthermore, 23.5-70% of the isolates from the sample were resistant to Vancomycin (30  $ \mu $ g), while 15-100% of those isolated was resistant to Oxacillin (1  $ \mu $ g).

### MAR phenotypes of S. aureus

Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotypes were determined for S. aureus (Table 3). The predominant MAR phenotypes for S. aureus isolated from this study area were PG-AP-AC-E-CRO-Ox and PG-AP-Ox in 19.2% and 20.5% of the isolates, respectively. Furthermore, MAR phenotypes PG-AP-AC-TMX-Ox-VA, PG-AP-AC-E-TMX-Ox-VA and PG-AP-TMX-Ox were obtained in 1.3% of the isolates. The MAR phenotypes PG-AP-AC-E-TMX-Ox, PG-AP-AC-E-CRO-Ox-VA and PG-AP-E were obtained in 1.3% of the isolates. Also PG-AP-AC-E-Ox-VA 3.8% and PG-AP-Ox-VA 7.7% were the MAR phenotypes for S. aureus isolated from this study area (Table 3).

It is thus evident that MAR S. aureus was isolated from all CCP. However, among the isolates from this study area 62.8% of the isolates develop MAR. Among all MAR phenotypes of S. aureus, 42.9% of them were resistance to six different antibiotics and 6.1% were resistance to seven antibiotics. Fifty one percent (51%) of them were resistance to 3 or 4 antibiotics.

## Discussion

In this study we described the isolation and antibiotic susceptibility characterization of  $ S.\ aureus $  from milk obtained from five different CCP levels. Our results indicate that 40.6% of the samples were positive for  $ S.\ aureus $  and that more of these bacteria were positively identified from milk samples. Several studies have been conducted in South Africa to evaluate the prevalence of  $ S.\ aureus $  in milk [13,26,27]. The results reported in our study were similarly high when compared to those studies [13,27]. Although the prevalence of  $ S.\ aureus $  has been reported to vary with the size and geographic region of the area sampled, a high proportion of these
