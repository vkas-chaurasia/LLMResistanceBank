_enterica_ serovars isolated from animal products in Tunisia carried _qnr_ gene [50]. In other studies in China _qnr_ A,
_qnr_ B and _qnr_ S genes detected with low percentage in _S._
_enterica_ serovar Enteritidis isolated from retail raw poultry [51, 52].
The _bla_ TEM gene was detected in 52.3% of all isolated
_E. coli_ and in 73.3% of ampicillin-resistant isolates. Other
studies detected _bla_ TEM in 97.1 and 75.0% of _E. coli_ isolates from lambs in Spain and meat products in Cambodia, respectively [32, 45]. In China, _bla_ TEM was identified
in 7.8% of ESBL-producing _E. coli_ recovered from meat
products [53].
The β-lactamase encoding gene _bla_ CMY was not found
in any of the isolated _E. coli_ . In contrast, _bla_ CMY-2 was
detected in 89.0% _E. coli_ isolated from poultry meat in
Denmark [54] and in 12.5% of ESBL-producing _E. coli_
isolated from meat products in Cambodia [32].
The _bla_ CTX-M detected in 42.9% of _E. coli_ isolated
in this study. In Ghana 50.0% of ESBL-producing _E._
_coli_ isolates from meat harboured _bla_ CTX-M [46] while
these β-lactamase encoding genes _bla_ CTX-M-15 and _bla_ CTX
M-9 [ were detected rarely (1.6%) in ] _[E. coli]_ [ isolates from ]
meat products in China [53].
The _bla_ SHV gene was not found in any of the _E. coli_ isolates. Controversially, previous studies detected _bla_ SHV in
9.4, 5.3 and 2.0% in meat products in China, broiler chickens and chicken carcasses in Iran, respectively [53, 55, 56].
_bla_ OXA-1 was detected in 14.3% of the _E. coli_ isolates
which is in contrast with previous report conducted in
retail meat in US where the gene could not be identified

[23].
The most common carbapenemase types were
_bla_ OXA-23 and _bla_ OXA-48 accounting for 47% of all
identified carbapenemase genes [25, 57]. In this study,
_bla_ OXA-23 was not identified in all isolated strains.
In isolated _E. coli_, _qnr_ A and _qnr_ B detected in 33.3% of
isolates, all nalidixic acid and/or ciprofloxacin resistant
isolates harboured both genes. While _qnr_ B and _qnr_ S were
identified in 10.4% of nalidixic acid resistant _E. coli_ isolated from Algerian retail chicken meat [44] and in 10.0%
of _E. coli_ isolates obtained from bovine carcasses in Mexico [58]. In contrast, _qnr_ A, _qrn_ B and _qrn_ S genes could
not be identified in enrofloxacin-resistant _E. coli_ strains
from poultry in Mexico [59].
The presence of genetic elements such as integrons and
transposons are often associated with multi-resistant
phenotypes among _Salmonella_ isolates [60]. In this study,
class 1 integron detected in 13.3% of _S. enterica_ serovars.
The identified gene cassettes were _dfr_ A15, _dfr_ A17 and
_aad_ A2. In previous studies, class 1 integron identified in
90.0% of multi-drug resistant _Salmonella_ isolates from
retail chicken meat in Japan and the identified genes cassettes were _dfr_ A1, _dfr_ A7, _aad_ A1, _aad_ B, and _cat_ B3 [61,



62]. The gene cassettes of class 1 integron which detected
in _Salmonella_ spp. isolated from poultry meat in Egypt
were harbouring _aac_ (3)-Id, _aad_ A2, _aad_ A4, _aad_ A7, _sat_,
_dfr_ A15, _lnu_ F and _est_ X resistance genes [7]. In a study
conducted in Portugal, 75.0% of _S. enterica_ isolated from
different sources including food products had one or two
class 1 integrons [63].
The identified gene cassettes of class 1 integron _dfr_ A1,
_dfr_ A15 and _dfr_ A1-orf which confer resistance to trimethoprim were identified in 14.3% of _E. coli_ isolated in this
study. This is in agreement with _E. coli_ isolates from retail
chickens in Japan [62] and in 1.9 and 11.4% of isolates
from Thai and Cambodian meat samples obtained from
slaughterhouses and fresh markets and the most common gene cassette was _dfr_ A12- _aad_ A2 [32].
Class 2 integrons were not detected in all isolates of
this study which is in contrast to 5.6% positive samples in
Egypt [10].
In this study, _mcr_ -1 gene associated with colistin
resistance was neither detected in _S. enterica_ nor _E. coli_
isolates. This result was in agreement with the result
reported by Doumith et al. [64] who investigated 24,000
isolates of _Enterobacteriaceae_ from food and humans
including _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ and found only 15 _mcr_ -1
positive isolates. Recently, Quesada et al. identified the
gene _mcr_ - _1_ in nine _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ isolates from
poultry and swine for the first time in Spain [65]. Jayol
et al. found the _mcr_ -1 in 13% of _E. coli_ and _S. enterica_

[66]. Considering the frequent use of colistin in animal
production and the importance of this antimicrobial for
the control of multi-resistant Gram-negative nosocomial
infections in humans, monitoring the dissemination of
resistance to colistin is mandatory.
In conclusion, the results of this study showed high
prevalence of _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ as foodborne pathogens isolated from poultry and beef meat in Egypt. The
emergence of antimicrobial resistance of _S. enterica_ and
_E. coli_ isolates is of public concerns in Egypt. Significant
resistance was detected to penicillin, cephalosporins,
tetracycline and sulphonamides. Dissemination of ESBL
and AmpC-β-lactamase resistance-associated genes in
_S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ was determined. Presence of class
1 integron in _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ and genes associated with antibiotic resistance was also confirmed. Class
2 integron was not detected in any isolate. Further work
should be performed to characterize _S. enterica_ and _E._
_coli_ isolates of animal and human origin from the same
region sharing the same resistance markers in order to
highlight potential horizontal gene transfer by these
zoonotic organisms.
