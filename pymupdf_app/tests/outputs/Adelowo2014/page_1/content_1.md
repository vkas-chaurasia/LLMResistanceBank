**Abstract**
Introduction: This study investigated the mechanisms of resistance in 36 _E. coli_ isolated from waste, litter, soil and water samples collected
from poultry farms in Southwestern Nigeria.
Methodology: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions of the isolates were determined using the methods of the Clinical and
Laboratory Standard Institute and resistance genes detected by PCR.
Results: A total of 30 isolates (94%) showed resistance to more than one antimicrobial. Percentage resistance was: tetracycline 81%,
sulphamethoxazole 67%, streptomycin 56%, trimethoprim 47 %, ciprofloxacin 42%, ampicillin 36%, spectinomycin 28%, nalidixic acid
25%, chloramphenicol 22%, neomycin 14%, gentamicin 8%, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftiofur, cefotaxime, colistin, florfenicol and
apramycin 0%. Resistance genes found among the isolates include _bla-TEM_ (85%), _sul2_ (67%), _sul3_ (17%), _aadA_ (65%), _strA_ (70%), _strB_
(61%), _catA1_ (25%), _cmlA1_ (13%), _tetA_ (21%) and _tetB_ (17%). Class 1 and 2 integrons were found in five (14%) and six (17%) isolates,
respectively, while one isolate was positive for both classes of integrons. Seven out of eight isolates with resistance to ciprofloxacin and MIC
≤ 32 mg/L to nalidixic acid contained _qnrS_ genes.
Conclusions: Our findings provided additional evidence that the poultry production environment in Nigeria represents an important reservoir
of antibiotic resistance genes such as _qnrS_ that may spread from livestock production farms to human populations via manure and water.

**Key words:** Farm waste; livestock production environment; _qnrS._

**Introduction** poultry waste [7,8,6,9], commercial poultry production



Antimicrobial drug use in livestock production has
been implicated as a risk factor in the development
and dissemination of drug resistance from livestock
production farms [1,2]. Food animals and their
production environments are reservoirs of both
resistant bacteria and resistance genes that could be
transferred to humans either by direct contact between
animals and humans or indirectly via the food
production chain [3,4]; or as a result of the spread of
animal waste on land [5,2]. In Nigeria, antimicrobial
agents are routinely used in livestock production
especially as additives to feed and water [6]. This may
result in a selective advantage and a consequent
increase in the abundance of resistant bacteria in
animals, their wastes and surrounding environment

[5]. Antibiotic resistant bacteria have been detected in



poultry waste [7,8,6,9], commercial poultry production
environments [10,11] and poultry products [12,13].

Most food animal production farms in Nigeria
have no waste treatment facility. Wastes generated on
these farms are either dumped in heaps on farmlands
or at remote locations, often inside or close to water
bodies. Wastes are also used as organic fertilizer or as
feed supplements, especially in fish ponds. This raises
the fear that human beings resident in the vicinity of
the farm and/or animal waste dump may be exposed to
antibiotic resistant bacteria in the waste. In addition,
close interaction between human and animal
ecosystems is a common occurrence in Nigeria with
livestock kept in close proximity to or inside human
residences. This practice has been shown to favour
high rates of transmission of zoonotic _E. coli_ between
livestock and humans in rural Uganda [14]. Although
_E. coli_ is a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract of
