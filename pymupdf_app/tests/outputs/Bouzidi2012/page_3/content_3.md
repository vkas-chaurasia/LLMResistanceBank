One pool of seven samples was collected on swabs from cages, and
1 pool of seven surface samples was collected from different places in
each henhouse, such as walls, water and feeding equipment.
For technical and economic reasons, during the first visit, we used
cotton-tipped swabs for environmental samples. The cotton-tipped
swab was moistened with sterile water and used to swab 5–10 cm of
cage surfaces, beneath and inside empty cages or troughs under nipple
lines. The cotton-tipped swabs were also used to wipe 20 cm² of feeding
and watering equipment. For this, each layer house was divided into
seven subsections, with three cotton-tipped swabs for each subsection.
During the second sampling period, four drag swabs (AES
Chemunex, Combourg, France) were used to collect dust from seven
cages in various places within each henhouse. Each swab was
sufficiently absorbent to collect the dust and dry manure from the
surfaces beneath and inside two empty cages per swab.
Three drag swabs were also used to swab a 0.5 m [2] surface area of
feeding equipment and approximately 30 cm² per swab of henhouse
walls. One pool of four samples of feed and one pool of four samples of
water were collected from flocks with 2400 to 3100 hens. Four 5 g subsamples of feed were collected from feeders, and four 5 mL sub-samples
of water were collected from nipples and reservoirs. For flocks with
4800 to 7200 hens, six 5 g sub-samples of feed and six 5 mL sub-samples
of water were collected from feeders, nipples or reservoirs.
Samples were taken from different places on each sampling visit.
The pooled samples were placed individually in sterile recipients or
sterile plastic pouches. Gloves were changed between each collection
of pooled samples. The samples were transported to the laboratory in
an icebox with freezer packs within 2 h of collection. Bacteriological
analysis was usually initiated on the day of sampling but sometimes
stored in the fridge at 4 °C for analysis the following day.


2.5. Bacteriological analysis of samples


The bacteriological analysis of samples was carried out according
to standard norm ISO 6579: 2002 (ISO (Comité international de
normalisation AW/9), 2002). Twenty five grams of each pooled feces
and feed sample was weighed before adding 225 mL of buffered
peptone water (BPW) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Each pool of
drag swabs used to sample dust and surfaces was immersed
separately in 100 mL BPW per swab. Each cotton-tipped swab was
placed in 9 mL BPW, and 25 mL water samples were placed in sterile
bags containing 225 mL buffered peptone water. Pooled feces and
feed samples were mixed in a Stomacher bag for 1 min. All the
samples were incubated for 18±2 h at 37 °C. Two milliliters of this
pre-enrichment broth was then used to inoculate a 20 mL MuellerKauffmann tetrathionate-Novobiocin (MKTTn) broth (AES Chemunex, Combourg, France) and 100 μL of the pre-enrichment broth was
used to inoculate 10 mL Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (Biokar, Beauvais, France). Both media were incubated for 24 h at 37 and 42 °C
respectively. Following incubation, one loopful from each selective
enrichment tube was streaked over two selective media – Hektoen
and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar plates (AES Chemunex,
Combourg, France) – prior to incubation at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. Two
typical colonies of Salmonella were confirmed by biochemical assays
on Triple Sugar Iron (Biokar, Beauvais, France) and API20E strips
(BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Salmonella isolates were then
serotyped by a slide agglutination test with polyvalent O and H
antiserum (Bio-Rad, Marne la coquette, France). The Kauffmann–
White scheme was used to serotype the different isolates (Popoff,
2001).


2.6. Antibiotic resistance analysis


Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion
method on Mueller-Hinton agar (Bio-Rad) in accordance with the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard (CLSI,



2006). The antimicrobial agents tested were ampicillin (10 μg),
amoxicillin+clavulanic acid (20, 10 μg), cephalothin (30 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), sulphonamides (300 μg), cotrimoxazole (1.25/23.75 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), streptomycin (10 μg),
kanamycin (30 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg),
nalidixic acid (30 μg), ofloxacin (5 μg) and enrofloxacin (5 μg). Zone
diameters were read using the automated Osiris scanner (Bio-Rad),
interpreted as per CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2009). Escherichia coli ATCC
25922 was used as quality-control organism.


2.7. Statistical analyses for factors associated with Salmonella flock
contamination


Data were analyzed using Epi-Info® software (Epi Info 3.5.1, Centers
for disease control and prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Freeware). Only
univariate analyses were performed due to the small sample. Links
between a certain factor and the presence of Salmonella did not
therefore take into account potential confounders as multivariate
regression models do. However, univariate associations suggest risk
indicators, and are a preliminary but necessary step in the investigation
of risk factors for any disease. Statistical analyses were limited to Fisher's
Exact tests and calculation of Relative Risks (RR) with their 95%
confidence intervals in order to quantify the relationship between each
factor and the Salmonella status of laying-hen flocks. Discrepancies may
exist between p-values and 95% confidence interval boundaries because
Fisher's Exact test is a non-parametric test and 95% confidence intervals
are calculated using a parametric method. The significance of
associations is based on Fisher's Exact test, and not on the presence or
absence of 1 in the confidence intervals. Only factors with a RR≥ 2 are
presented. All tests were two-tailed and p-values b 0.05 wereconsidered
significant.


3. Results


3.1. Salmonella prevalence


Eight of the 18 flocks tested positive for Salmonella spp. Table 1 gives
a detailed overview of the laying-hen flocks sampled. Salmonella
contamination was higher at the end of the laying period than at the
beginning or middle. The 70- to 86-wk-old hens had the highest
prevalence of Salmonella (7/17, 41.17%), followed by the 22- to 31-wkold hens, which had a prevalence of 20% (3/15). Salmonella prevalence
was lowest halfway through laying (47–60 week) with 7.14% (1/14).
Furthermore, of the three layer houses tested positive at the beginning
of laying, Salmonella had been isolated at the end of laying in the
previous two flocks reared in the same layer houses. However, no
statistical analysis on the association of Salmonella prevalence and the
hens' three age classes could be performed because of the relatively
small number of flocks sampled.
The number of positive samples within flocks was very low. Only
19 out of 2754 samples analyzed tested positive for Salmonella.
Thirteen isolates (0.80%) were recovered from the 1610 feces samples
and four (1.24%) from the 322 dust samples. Salmonella was also
isolated from two (0.80%) out of 250 water samples (Table 2).


3.2. Serovars encountered and antimicrobial resistance patterns


The serotyping of 19 Salmonella strains revealed nine serovars
from eight positive flocks, but no clearly dominant serovar emerged.
One serovar was isolated in five positive flocks, and two serovars were
isolated in three other flocks (Table 1). The six most prevalent
serovars were S. Enteritidis (n=4), S. Kentucky (n=3), S. Hadar
(n=3), S. Virchow (n=2), S. Heidelberg (n=2) and S. Manhattan
(n=2) (Table 2). S. Enteritidis and S. Virchow were each recovered
from two successive flocks reared in the same two houses (flocks no. 2
