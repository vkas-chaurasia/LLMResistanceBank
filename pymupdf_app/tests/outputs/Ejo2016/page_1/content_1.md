_Salmonella_ has been found to be the major cause of foodborne diseases and a serious public health problem in the world, with an
increasing concern for the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant strains. A cross-sectional study was conducted between
February 2014 and December 2015 on food items of animal origin to assess the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles
of _Salmonella_ isolates using standard bacteriological methods. The overall prevalence rate of 5.5% was recorded from the total
analyzed food items of animal origin. _Salmonella_ isolates were detected from 12% of raw meat, 8% of minced meat, 2.9% of burger
samples, 18% of raw eggs, and 6% of raw milk. Furthermore, antimicrobial susceptibility test identified 47.6% resistant _Salmonella_
isolates, 28.6% intermediately sensitive isolates, and 23.8% susceptible isolates. Among _Salmonella_ isolates tested, 42.6%, 28.6%, and
14.3% were found to be relatively resistant to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and ampicillin, respectively, while 9.5%–
19% were intermediately resistant to tetracycline, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, and nitrofurantoin. Therefore, our findings
provide the prevalence and drug resistance of _Salmonella_ from foods of animal origin and contribute information to scientists as
well as public health researchers to minimize the prevalent and resistant foodborne _Salmonella_ species in Ethiopia.



**1. Background**


Foodborne diseases are among the most widespread global
public health problems of recent times, and their implication
for health and economy is increasingly recognized [1, 2].
According to reports, every year, a huge number of people
suffer from foodborne diseases worldwide due to contaminated food and water consumption [2, 3]. A wide range of
pathogens play a role in foodborne disease, most of which
have a zoonotic origin and have carriers in healthy food
animals from which they spread to an increasing variety of
foods of animal origin and are considered as major vehicles of
foodborne infections [4]. Among the pathogens, _Salmonella_
is considered the most prevalent foodborne pathogen worldwide [4, 5] and has long been recognized as an important
zoonotic microorganism of economic significance in animals
and humans [5], predominantly in the developing countries.
Consumption of raw or unsafe food, cross-contamination,



improper food storage, poor personal hygiene practices,
inadequate cooling and reheating of food items, and a
prolonged time lapse between preparing and consuming food
items were mentioned as contributing factors to an outbreak
of salmonellosis in humans [3, 5]. The ubiquity of _Salmonella_
isolates creates a persistent contamination hazard in all raw
foods [5] and also in animal-origin food products, which are
often implicated in sporadic cases and outbreaks of human
salmonellosis [2, 6]. Foodborne transmission is recognized
as the major cause of _Salmonella_ infections, with many food
sources and supplies implicated in these infections [2].
Antibiotic-resistant _Salmonella_ infections of both human
and animal are universal concerns, particularly in developing
countries where the risk of infection is high because of unhygienic living conditions, close contact and sharing of houses
between animals and humans [7], and the traditions of consumption of raw or undercooked animal-origin food items.
There is an increasing concern with this pathogen due to the
