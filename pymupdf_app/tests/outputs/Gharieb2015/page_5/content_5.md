of the variable amplicons of class I integrons denoted by
asterisks (Fig. 5) revealed the presence of gene cassettes
containing aminoglycoside acetyltransferase [ _aac(3)_ - _Id_
or _aacCA5_ ] gene which confers resistance against gentamycin, aminoglycoside adenyltransferase ( _aadA2_, _aadA4_,
_aadA7_ ) genes that confer resistance to streptomycin
and spectinomycin, streptothricin acetyltransferase ( _sat_ )
encoding resistance against streptothricin, dihydrofolate reductase type 15 ( _dfrA15_ ) that confers resistance
to trimethoprim, _lnuF_ gene that codes for lincosamides
resistance (lincomycin and clindamycin) and putative



esterase ( _estX_ ). Interestingly, the _aac (3)_ - _Id_ plus _aadA7_
were the most predominant resistance genes identified
in class I integron gene cassettes of 1600 bp ( _S._ Derby,
duck), 1500 bp (untypable strain, duck) and 1550 bp ( _S._
Typhimurium, chicken). The same cassettes harboring _aac (3)_ - _Id_ and _aadA7_ genes were previously identified in class I integron of _S._ Haifa (GenBank accession
no. AY563051) [21], _S._ Newport (AY458224) [22] and _S._
Kentucky (AY463797) [23]. Despite the presence of these
genes, some strains such as _S._ Derby was susceptible to
gentamycin and _S._ Typhimurium strains (chicken) were
