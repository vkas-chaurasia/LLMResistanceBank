florfenicol, and cefotaxime. In contrast, we observed
a high level of antimicrobial resistance to tetracycline
(n = 65; 93%), ciprofloxacin (n = 61, 87%), nalidixic
acid (n = 57; 81%), sulfamethoxazole (n = 61; 87%),
and trimethoprim (n = 53; 76%), respectively (Table
5). None of the chicken isolates showed high levels
of resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC ≥ 2 µg/mL);
however, 87% (n = 61) of the isolates exhibited
reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. The reduced
susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was observed in all of
the following serovars: _S_ . Virchow (n = 50; 100%), _S_ .
Derby (n = 4; 100%), _S_ . Haifa (n = 2; 100%), _S_ .
Bredeney (n = 1; 100%), _S_ . Onireke (n = 1; 100%), _S_ .
Mbandaka (n = 2; 33%), and _S_ . Muenster (n = 1;
20%), respectively (Table 5). The four isolates of _S._
Derby were all susceptible to nalidixic acid but
exhibited reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin,
indicating a plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
phenotype. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the three
most commonly isolated serovars revealed that _S._
Virchow (n = 50), _S._ Mbandaka (n = 6), and _S._
Muenster (n = 5) were also the serovars with the most
resistant susceptibility patterns. Those serovars
showed resistance to ten ( _S._ Virchow), nine ( _S._
Muenster), and eight ( _S._ Mbandaka) of the seventeen
tested antimicrobials, respectively (Table 5). Six
resistance patterns were observed among _S_ . Virchow;
most (n = 31; 62%,) were resistant to nalidixic acid,
sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim,
while only 8% (n = 4) showed multidrug resistance to
seven antimicrobials, namely ampicillin, gentamicin,
nalidixic acid, neomycin, sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline, and trimethoprim.



_Detection of qnr genes_

Four _S._ Derby isolates from chickens showed
reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and were
susceptible to nalidixic acid. All four harbored the
_qnrS1_ gene. The _qnrS1_ positive _S_ . Derby were from
farm K (n = 1), farm I (n = 2), and farm F (n = 1).


**Discussion**

In this study, the overall positive isolation rate of
_Salmonella_ species from human blood samples is
comparable with that from Ethiopia (4%) [30] but
higher than those from Kenya (1%) [31] and
Mozambique (2%) [32]. On the other hand, higher
rates have been reported from Congo (7%) [33] and
Malawi (6% and 8%) [15,34]. The skewed
distribution of 1:0.5 between males and females is
difficult to explain, but may be caused by the fact that
more males were examined or that the male
population has a higher susceptibility to infections.

Our data reveals the relative importance of
_Salmonella_ associated with human bacteraemia
predominated by _S._ Enteritidis and _S_ . Typhimurium
in Ibadan, Nigeria. Similar trends have been observed
in African countries where _S._ Enteritidis and _S_ .
Typhimurium are the most common serovars causing
human salmonellosis [9,11,13,15,35-40]. It is
interesting to note that the majority of the _S_ .
Enteritidis and _S_ . Dublin were isolated from hospitals
A, B, and C, whereas the remaining hospitals found
very few. _S_ . Typhimurium was mostly isolated from
hospital B. Kariuki _et al._ found that the main serovars
obtained from children with bacteraemia in Kenya
were _S._ Enteritidis (55%) and _S_ . Typhimurium (33%)
