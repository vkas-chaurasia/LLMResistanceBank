zoonotic agents that can be implicated in animal and
human infectious diseases [8].
Raw or undercooked chicken meat is particularly
prone to contamination. The microbiological quality of
chicken meat as purchased by consumers depends mostly
on; the slaughter process, sanitation during processing
and packaging, maintenance of adequate cold chain storage
from the processing to the retail level and to the consumer
and finally sanitation during handling at the retail end

[9-12]. Chicken meat can also act as a reservoir of drug
resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance among E. coli
in food animals such as chicken is of increasing concern
due to the potential for transfer of these resistant pathogens to the human population [13-15].
In urban areas such as Nairobi, marketing of chicken
products is generally undertaken in retail outlets such as
supermarkets, local butcheries located in different geosocio-economic status and even from street vendors in
some low income settings. Public health research in
countries such as the United States of America focusing on food qualities demonstrated that stores in low
socio-economic status populations, because of a higher
prevalence of food safety violations, were shown to be
consistently exposed to food that is of lower microbial
quality. Because of this access pattern, such populations
are placed at increased risk of food-borne illnesses [16,17].
In Kenya, there is a paucity of data on coliform contamination and antimicrobial resistant E. coli in raw retail
chicken supplied to retail outlets in the city. Studies related to antimicrobial resistant E. coli have been done on
isolates from farm animals and chicken carcass samples
from slaughter [18] but not from raw retail chicken which
is made available to consumers. Furthermore, no studies
are available on the contamination levels in chicken meat
available to populations living in different socio-economic
status yet, these data are essential for performing risk
assessment and risk management for food safety. This
study reports on the microbiological quality and safety
of chicken meat available to populations who purchase
from different retail outlets (supermarkets, retail outlets
in high income areas, retail outlets in middle income
areas and retail outlets in low income areas) in the city
of Nairobi.


Methods
Study area and sampling
The study was conducted in Nairobi County. Nairobi is
the administrative and commercial capital in Kenya and
home to thousands of businesses including the retail
chicken business.. There is a huge disparity in income
levels and population densities in Nairobi. The people
living in the western suburbs are generally the more
affluent while the lower and middle-income populations
dominate the eastern suburbs [19].



In a cross-sectional study, chicken samples were randomly purchased from August 2011 to February 2012
from different retail outlets spread over 28 locations in
Nairobi. In order to take into account compounding
factors of socio-economic status within Nairobi, the
retail outlets where samples were purchased were classified into supermarkets, shops from high end areas (low
densely populated, up-market residential suburbs), shops
from middle end areas (middle densely populated areas
further classified into high middle and low middle income
areas) and shops from low end areas (densely populated
slums and informal settings). Classification of locations
into these groups was done based on a study on residential segregation in Nairobi [20]. A total of two hundred
chicken samples (n = 39, supermarkets; n = 39 high end
area retail outlets; n = 84, high middle end area retail outlets; n = 20, low middle end area retail outlets and n = 18,
low end area retail outlets) were purchased. Both freshly
slaughtered as well as samples that have been in storage in
freezers were included in the study. Packaged chicken
samples were transported in cool boxes to the laboratory
for bacterial isolation within 1 hour from time of collection. Samples were processed at the Kenya Medical
Research Institute, Centre for Microbiology Research
laboratories, Kenyatta hospital compound. Ethical approval
to perform this study was obtained from the Ethics Review
Committee at Kenya Medical Research Institute, Reference
SSC No. 2036.


Bacteriological analysis
Enumeration of E. coli and coliform bacteria from the
chicken samples was performed as described in the
Association of Analytical Communities International,
official methods of analysis using 3 M petrifilm E. coli/
Coliform count plates [21] with slight modification.
The samples, which included the skin of the chicken
along with the meat itself, were aseptically removed
from the package and 100 gram piece of chicken was
weighed and placed in 100 ml sterile distilled water.
One ml of the rinse water from the sample was placed
onto the center of the bottom film and covered carefully
avoiding entrapment of air bubbles and the plates from all
samples incubated for 24 ± 2 hrs at 35°C. Colony counts
for each petrifilm were done the following day and the microbial count results converted to the base 10 logarithm
of the number of colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml)
rinse water obtained from the samples. Typical E. coli
colonies growing on the petrifilm were then selected
and sub-cultured in MacConkey agar to obtain pure
colonies. After a series of biochemical tests for confirmative identification [22], positive E. coli isolates were stored
at −80°C in trypticase soy broth for further antimicrobial
susceptibility tests and PCR to determine the presence of
virulence genes.
