and fecal samples were almost identical to resistant isolates
from geographically linked chickens, whereas drugsusceptible human E. coli strains were genetically distinct
from avian ones, suggesting a possible dissemination via the
poultry. E. coli strains could also be transmitted from poultry
to humans through meat consumption and environmental contamination with manure or faeces of wild or domestic birds

[21, 22]. Another route of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli entry
into the community is through occupational exposure to
E. coli from live-animal contact in the broiler chicken industry

[23]. This had been confirmed by our findings, as we observed
clonality between chicken and chicken farmers’ strains, and
between the latter and human pathogenic ones.



The sporadic nature and the appearance of new pathogenic
E. coli strains by virtue of novel STs suggests that these strains
may be commensal that have acquired the antibiotic resistance
encoding plasmids (especially ESBL) [24]. This is in agreement with our findings, as we observed clonality between a
blaCTX-M-15+ ExPEC strain and one chicken-farmer commensal strain and another blaCTX-M-15+ ExPEC strain with two
chicken commensal ones (Fig. 1). Acquisition of resistance
genes may also account for the differences in drug resistance
between our clonal avian–human strains and clonal commensal–pathogenic strains, as the drug selection pressure in clinical environments is the major cause of the accumulation of
resistance determinants against antibiotics. According to
