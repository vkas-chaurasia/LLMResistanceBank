**Abstract**
**Background:** Thermophilic _Campylobacter_ species are a major cause of bacterial foodborne diarrhoea in humans
worldwide. Poultry and their products are the predominant source for human campylobacteriosis. Resistance of
_Campylobacter_ to antibiotics is increasing worldwide, but little is known about the antibiotic resistance in _Campy-_
_lobacter_ isolated from chicken in Kenya. In this study, 35 suspected _Campylobacter_ strains isolated from faeces and
cloacal swabs of chicken were tested for their susceptibility to seven antibiotics using a broth microdilution assay and
molecular biological investigations.
**Results:** Overall, DNA of thermophilic _Campylobacter_ was identified in 53 samples by PCR (34 _C. jejuni_, 18 _C. coli_ and
one mix of both species) but only 35 _Campylobacter_ isolates (31 _C. jejuni_ and 4 _C. coli_ ) could be re-cultivated after
transportation to Germany. Isolates were tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics using a broth microdilution assay.
Additionally, molecular biological detection of antibiotic resistance genes was carried out. _C. jejuni_ isolates showed a
high rate of resistance to nalidixic acid, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin of 77.4, 71.0 and 71.0 %, respectively. Low resist‑
ance (25.8 %) was detected for gentamicin and chloramphenicol. Multidrug resistance in _C. jejuni_ could be detected
in 19 (61.3 %) isolates. Resistance pattern of _C. coli_ isolates was comparable. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was confirmed
by MAMA–PCR and PCR–RFLP in all phenotypically resistant isolates. The _tet_ (O) gene was detected only in 54.5 % of
tetracycline resistant _C. jejuni_ isolates. The _tet_ (A) gene, which is also responsible for tetracycline resistance, was found
in 90.3 % of _C. jejuni_ and in all _C. coli_ isolates. Thirteen phenotypically erythromycin-resistant isolates could not be char‑
acterised by using PCR–RFLP and MAMA–PCR.
**Conclusions:** To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report about resistance to antibiotics in thermo‑
philic _Campylobacter_ originating from chicken in Kenya. _Campylobacter_ spp. show a high level of resistance to cipro‑
floxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline but also a remarkable one to chloramphenicol and gentamicin and they are
multidrug resistant. Resistance to antibiotics is a global public health concern. In Kenya, resistance surveillance needs
further attention in the future. Efforts to establish at least a National Laboratory with facilities for performing pheno‑
typic and genotypic characterization of thermophilic _Campylobacter_ is highly recommended.

humans worldwide [1]. Campylobacteriosis exceed the
total number of those caused by _Salmonella, Shigella_,
and _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 in humans, recently [2].
_Campylobacter_ infections are normally self-limiting in
adults but can cause diarrhoea or even mortality in children in developing as well as in developed countries [3,
