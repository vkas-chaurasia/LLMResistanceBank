Significant resistance was detected to penicillin, cephalosporins, tetracycline and sulphonamides. Dissemination of ESBL and AmpC- $ \\beta $ -lactamase resistance-associated genes in  $ S.\\ enterica $  and  $ E.\\ coli $  was determined. Presence of class 1 integron in  $ S.\\ enterica $  and  $ E.\\ coli $  and genes associated with antibiotic resistance was also confirmed. Class 2 integron was not detected in any isolate. Further work should be performed to characterize  $ S.\\ enterica $  and  $ E.\\ coli $  isolates of animal and human origin from the same region sharing the same resistance markers in order to highlight potential horizontal gene transfer by these zoonotic organisms.",
