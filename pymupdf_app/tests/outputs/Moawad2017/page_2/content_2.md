**Background**
In spite of the improved technology and hygienic practices in developed countries at all stages of poultry and
beef meat production, foodborne infections remain as a
continuous threat to human and animal health. _Escheri-_
_chia_ ( _E_ .) _coli_ and _S. enterica_ serovars are the dominant
members of _Enterobacteriaceae_ causing foodborne infections. The expansion of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is
also an emerging public health hazard due to the compromised efficacy in the treatment of infectious diseases

[1].
The continuous exposure of bacterial strains by
β-lactams has led to dynamic and massive production
and mutation of β-lactamases [2]. Extended-spectrum
β-lactamases (ESBLs) are derived from point mutations
in the _bla_ TEM-1 and _bla_ SHV-1 _β_ -lactamase genes, which
cannot hydrolyse cephamycins and are inhibited by clavulanic acid [3], while ampicillin class C _β_ -lactamase
( _Amp_ C) enzymes are active on cephamycins as well as
oxyiminocephalosporins and monobactams [4]. ESBLs
are mostly located on mobile genetic elements (plasmids
or integrons), which can facilitate their mobility from
bacterial species to others by horizontal gene transfer [5].
In Egypt, _Salmonella_ isolates from chicken meat and
organs showed high resistance to different antibiotic
classes [6–8] where also, ESBL-producing _E_ . _coli_ were
isolated from retail chicken meat and dairy products in
Egypt [9, 10].
Quinolones considered as drugs of choice for treatment
of human infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
However, resistance to quinolones has been emerged
over the time due to misuse and/or overdose of drugs in
human and veterinary practice [11]. Plasmid-mediated
quinolone resistance (PMQR) represented by quinolone
resistance ( _qnr_ ) genes is widely distributed among bacteria [12–14].
Integrons are genetic elements able to capture individual antibiotic resistance genes including β-lactamases
encoding genes and stimulate their transcription and
expression [15]. The capture and spread of antibiotic



resistance determinants by integrons stimulates the rapid
evolution of multidrug resistances (MDR) among Gramnegative bacteria [16]. Among five main integron classes,
integrons 1 and 2 are most frequent in Gram-negative
bacteria. More than 70 different antibiotic resistance
genes have been characterized within integrons [16].
Colistin as antimicrobial substance was used against
Gram-negative bacteria. Its usage has been limited due to
its systemic toxicity but it was re-introduced as a last-line
option in treatment of human infections [17, 18].
This study aimed to discuss the prevalence, serotyping, antibiotic resistance and characterization of resistance-associated genes in _S. enterica_ serovars and _E. coli_
isolated from beef and poultry meat products in the Nile
Delta, Egypt.


**Methods**
**Sampling, isolation and identification of bacteria**
One hundred and eighty samples were randomly collected aseptically (90 chicken and 90 beef meat and
organs) from slaughterhouses and markets in four districts in northern Egypt (Dakahlia, Damietta, Kafr ElSheikh and Gharbia governorates). Briefly, 30 samples
of freshly slaughtered chickens and 30 samples of native
frozen chickens from restaurants and supermarkets (each
15 from breast and from thigh muscles and skin) were
taken. Thirty samples of organs (gizzard and liver) were
collected from freshly slaughtered chickens. In addition,
30 beef meat samples of freshly slaughtered carcasses
(neck, brisket, flank and rump muscles) were obtained
from slaughterhouses. Thirty samples from locally frozen
beef meat, collected from supermarkets and restaurants
and 30 samples from organs (liver, spleen and heart)
from freshly slaughtered animals were used in this study
(Tables 1, 2).
Ten grams of each meat and organ sample were incised
using sterile scalpel and forceps, transported immediately to the laboratory in ice bags, then transferred into
sterile homogenizer flask containing 45 ml of nutrient broth (Oxoid, Manchester, UK). The mixture was
