Enteritidis isolates, resistances to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, sulfonamides and streptomycin were observed in 20 (26%), five (6.5%), three (3.9%) and one (1.3%) isolates, respectively. In addition, a single isolate showed intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, but resistances to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tobramycin and trimethoprim were not detected (Table 1). Overall, 51 isolates (66.2%) were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested while only 26 (33.8%) were resistant to one or more compounds. The genes responsible for the observed resistances are shown in Table 1. Sulfonamide resistance was encoded by sul1 or sul3, detected in one and two isolates, respectively. The streptomycin-resistant isolate harbored the strB gene but was negative for strA. The  $ bla_{TEM-1-like} $  and  $ bla_{SHV} $  genes were found in four and one of the ampicillin resistant isolates, respectively. The gene intI1, encoding the integrase of class 1 integrons, was not detected in the sul1- or sul3-positive S. Enteritidis isolates. Two mutations in the gyrA gene, changing Asp87 (GAC) to Tyr (TAC) and Asp87 (GAC) to Asn (AAC) were identified as responsible for nalidixic acid resistance in three and two of the isolates tested, respectively. In four other cases, mutations in the QRDR of gyrA were not detected; thus further research will be needed to establish the genetic basis of their resistance. With regard to PMQR genes, qnrB was present in the single isolate with intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (1.3%), while qnrA, qnrS and  $ aac(6')-Ib-cr $  genes were not observed. By combining resistant-phenotypes and genes involved, a total of seven profiles (R1 to R7) were identified (Table 1).",

The genetic relatedness of 36 isolates covering different combinations of resistance, virulence and plasmid profiles, were investigated by PFGE. Four closely related pulsotypes, named X1–X4, were found (Fig. 1B; Table 1). The major pulsotype was X1 that encompassed 29 isolates, while X2, X3 and X4 included only one, two and four isolates, respectively. X1 was associated with isolates of different origin (healthy and sick chickens as well as environmental samples) and with diverse resistance, virulence and plasmid profiles.",

Enteritidis isolates recovered in Tunisia from chicken facilities (healthy and sick animals as well as the farm environment) during a period of five years were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility and the genetic basis of the observed resistances. More than half of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested, which is consistent with other studies indicating that antimicrobial drug resistance is uncommon in S. Enteritidis  $ [23–25] $ . In the present study, a low incidence of streptomycin, ampicillin and sulfonamides resistance (1.3%, 3.9% and 6.5%, respectively), and a relatively high level of nalidixic acid resistance (26%) were observed. The spread of sulfonamides resistance in Enterobacteriaceae including S. enterica is largely due to the frequent location of sul1 and sul3 genes in class 1 integrons, which often contain gene cassettes encoding resistance also to other antimicrobials. Although these genes were identified as responsible for sulfonamides resistance in the S. Enteritidis isolates from Tunisia, neither intI1 nor any gene cassette characteristically associated with class 1 integrons, were detected  $ [26] $ . However, the presence of defective class 1 integrons cannot be ruled out.",

Antimicrobial agents used to be widely administered in animal husbandry for growth promotion, a practice now banned in many countries, but still common in others. In Tunisia it was banned since 1999, although the law is not enforced. Unfortunately, official documents about the use of antimicrobials in Tunisian avian husbandry are not available. However, according to veterinarians and farmers, florfenicol (fenicol), ofloxacin (second generation fluoroquinolone) and doxycycline (tetracycline) are commonly administered in avian farms to treat some infections, specifically chronic respiratory diseases, colibacillosis or necrotic enteritis. These antimicrobials are sometimes excessively applied with a concurrent lack of bacteriological analysis. Thus, a better control of antimicrobial usage in chicken production systems in Tunisia is required.",
