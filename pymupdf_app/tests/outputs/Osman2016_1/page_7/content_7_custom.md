to multiple clinically important antimicrobial classes ( **Table 4** ).
In addition, it was noticed that 49/50 Staphylococcus isolates were
MDR (non-susceptible to ≥1 agent in ≥3 antimicrobial classes)
while 1/10 of the S. hyicus did not apply to this as it was only
resistant to two classes of antibiotics although the number of
antibiotics were five (P, OX, MET, SAM, and SXT). S. lentus was
the only species to be PDR as it was resistant to the 12 antibiotics
(P, OX, MET, SAM, CN, E, DA, C, TE, VA, SXT, and CIP)
which represented nine classes and consequently, the remaining
48 Staphylococcus isolates were XDR as they were resistant to ≥1
agent in all but ≤2 classes ( **Table 4** ).


Antimicrobial Resistance Genes
Of the 50 Staphylococcus isolates, two of the CPS species
(2/3 S. aureus; 4/10 S. hyicus) were identified positive for
mecA (6/50) while six out of the seven CNS species expressed
the mecA gene (4/13 S. epidermedius; S. lugdunensis 4/15;
S. haemolyticus 1/1; S. hominus 2/3; S. schleiferi 1/2 and
S. lentus 1/1) ( **Table 4** ). With the exception of 1/8 S. lugdunensis
isolates which was susceptible to oxacillin, mecA-positive, four
Staphylococcus isolates (3/10 S. hyicus; 1/1 S. intermedius)
were resistant to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, erythromycin,
methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim,
and vancomycin ( **Table 4** ). Forty seven out of the fifty isolates
(47/50) were resistant to penicillin and tetracycline, while only
one was resistant to chloramphenicol. Methicillin-resistant nonStaphylococcus aureus (MRNSA) isolates were resistant to nine of
the 12 antimicrobials on the panel, including one to gentamicin.
Interestingly, two observations were recorded: (1) one of
the three S. aureus did not carry the mecA gene and was not
even phenotypically characterized as MRS ( **Table 5** ); and (2)
the resistance gene mecA was present in the S. lugdunensis
isolate (1/8) and which was phenotypically characterized as
methicillin-susceptible non-Staphylococcus aureus (MSNSA) but
at the same time phenotypically oxacillin resistant ( **Table 4** ). The
resistance gene tested mecA was detected in 16/26 methicillinresistant non-Staphylococcus aureus (MRNSA) isolates ( **Table 5** ),
while cfr was not detected in any of the isolates ( **Table 4** ).
Of the three MSSA isolates, two carried the gyrA gene

and one carried the gyrB gene ( **Table 4** ). The 50 isolates
of Staphylococcus species namely: aureus, hyicus, simulans,
lugdunensis, hominus, hemolyticus, epidermidis, intermedius,
and S. sciuri were non-cfr-carriers. Our susceptibility testing
showed that, all non-cfr-carrying staphylococci (23/50) were
resistant to the 12 antibiotics tested in the present with varying
degrees. Of the 50 isolates, 40/50 isolates were gentamicinresistant, 37/50 were oxacillin resistant while only 16/50 were
ciprofloxacin-resistant. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility
testing indicated that the non-cfr-carrying CNS exhibited also
expanded resistance to antimicrobial agents other than those
included in the cfr-mediated PhLOPSA phenotype ( **Table 4** )

[The Cfr rRNA Methyltransferase confers resistance to several
classes of antibiotics (phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones,
pleuromutilins, and streptogramin A; PhLOPSA phenotype)].
It was possible to conclude that 25/34 of the MR-NSA strains
