a b s t r a c t


Campylobacteriosis in humans is caused by thermotolerant Campylobacter spp, following consumption of
contaminated poultry, most commonly broiler.
The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of contamination by thermotolerant Campylobacter
and to characterize antimicrobial resistance of the strains isolated from broilers in some farms and
slaughterhouses in the region of Algiers.
One hundred droppings samples, 100 contents of ceaca and 100 neck skins were taken from six poultry
farms and five slaughterhouses, than analyzed according to NF. ISO 10272-1/1995 norm and the OIE
recommendations. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined according to the guidelines of the CASFM/2010 by disc diffusion method.
Thermotolerant Campylobacter strains were isolated from 85%, 98%, and 80% of droppings, caecal
content and neck skin, respectively. All the strains (100%) were resistant to nalidixic acid and sensitive to
gentamicin and to chloramphenicol. 83.7% of them were resistant to tetracycline and to ciprofloxacin,
75.3% to ampicillin, 46.8% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 21.7% were resistant to erythromycin. All the
isolates showed a multi-drug resistance. Nineteen different profiles were identified with “AM, AMC, NA,
CIP, TE” combination as the most common profile identified for 27% (n ¼ 74) of isolated strains. In
addition, 15% of the strains were resistant to both erythromycin and ciprofloxacin, which are systematically used in treatment of human Campylobacter infections.
Our results showed a high prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter with multidrug resistance
profiles in poultry farms and slaughterhouses of Algiers. These results stress that the risk of human
contamination throughout the food chain is very high, which may generate: i) a danger of food poisoning
by ingestion of chicken meat and chicken meat products and, ii) a cross-resistance to antibiotics between
human and avian strains.

In human health, Campylobacter is considered as the major
cause of diarrheal illnesses and, the most common bacterial cause
of gastroenteritis in the world (Bolla & Garnotel, 2008), causing up
to 14% of diarrhea worldwide. It is estimated that 2.5 million of the
diarrhea worldwide occur each year, resulting in 13,000 hospitalizations and 124 deaths (Braam, 2004).

In western Algeria, a caseecontrol study in infants showed that
Campylobacter were isolated in 17.7% of the 411 patients and in
14.9% of the 247 controls (Megraud et al.,1990). However, no official
data concerning contamination of poultry or other food products in
Algeria is available.
Compared to Salmonella, Campylobacter isolation frequency
from human diarrheal stool samples is generally similar or higher;
thus they represent a major problem in microbiological food safety.
Campylobacter’s ubiquitous nature and extent of adaptation to wild,
farm animals and pets, contribute to the introduction and persistence of this bacteria in different biotopes and to contamination of
the foodstuffs (Federighi, 2005, pp. 145e167). While numerous
potential vehicles of transmission exist, commercial chicken meat
