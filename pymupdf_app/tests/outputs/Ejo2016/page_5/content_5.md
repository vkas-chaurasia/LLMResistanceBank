prevalence of _Salmonella_ in this study is greater than 5% in
Thailand [24]. The variations in the prevalence could probably be due to improper handling of meat, personal hygiene
of food handlers, improper cleaning of cutting utensils,
and possible cross-contamination in butcher shops. Workers
can play a significant role in spreading the contamination
during retailing and preparation [14, 25]. Recently, Garedew
et al. [25] proved that butcher shop premises and utensils
sanitation and personnel’s hygiene were poor in this study
area. There is a risk of _Salmonella_ infection if the meat is
improperly cooked and consumed raw, or if there is crosscontamination of _Salmonella_ with other foods that are consumed raw [21]. The study also suggested that overall crosscontamination, environmental contamination, and food handler contamination might be considered as a common source
of _Salmonella_ along the food preparation. _Salmonella_ infection can occur via cross-contamination of meat in slaughterhouses, butcher shops, and the kitchen during food preparation. Contaminated raw or undercooked red meats can serve
as main vehicles of transmission for _Salmonella_ [11, 25].
In our study, isolated _Salmonella_ spp. in minced meat
were 8%, which was comparable with the previous studies
done by Nyeleti et al. [10] (7.9%) and Zewdu and Cornelius

[26] (8%) in Ethiopia. However, it was lower than that
reported by Molla et al. [12] (12.1%) and Ejeta et al. [13]
(14.4%). This prevalence difference might be due to variations
of the methods used for traditional minced meat preparation for human consumption in the different geographical
locations of the country. This is possibly due to the fact
that minced meat is a combination of red meat parts from
different sources that are eventually ground together [13],
which could further magnify _Salmonella_ contamination. This
observation can be correlated to cross-contamination during
handling and grinding of minced meat. In Ethiopia, traditionally prepared minced meat is often eaten raw or after minimal cooking, and it may be the potential source of _Salmonella_
infection for the public in the country. In this study, only one
burger sample was contaminated by _Salmonella_ spp. The reason might be due to improperly cooked meat or poor personal
hygiene of food handlers or inadequate cleaning of utensils



and equipment or cross-contamination with other products
like vegetables and fruits. Tomatoes have been indicated
as a common food product involved in many _Salmonella_
outbreaks [27]. On the other hand, an irregular water supply
to most of the mass catering establishments in this study area
made washing practices more difficult and, consequently,
washing utensils and knives was infrequently practiced [25].
In the category of raw eggs, we recorded a contamination
rate of 18%. Various contamination levels were reported by
numerous studies worldwide: 8% from chicken eggs in Dhaka
city [28] and 24% in Nigeria [29]. Conversely, the present
finding was higher than 0.3% in Dhaka [30]. _Salmonella_
prevalence from eggs in this study might be explained by
environmental contamination during storage and transportation and ineffective cleaning of eggs. Moreover, the management system in practice could also be the probable reason for
the variation of the prevalence. Egg contamination can occur
in the infected ovary of the hen and also through egg contact
with fecal material or it might be due to contamination of
eggs during their supply from chicken owners to wholesale
and retail markets. _Salmonella_ detection from raw milk in
the present study was comparable with a study conducted
in Nigeria [31] and lower than 20% prevalence in Ethiopia

[32]. This difference might arise from milking contamination,
unclean equipment, and poor hygiene of milk maid and handlers. However, it is higher than the prevalence of 2.1%, which
is found in Ethiopia [33]. As indicated by Garedew et al. [14],
unclean environmental conditions and poor udder preparation might expose raw milk to bacterial contamination.
No _Salmonella_ was isolated from pasteurized milk, cottage cheese, cream cake, egg sandwich, and pizza samples.
Even though some studies reported _Salmonella_ isolation from
pasteurized milk in Ethiopia [26], proper pasteurization of
the milk, the good sanitary condition of the processing plant,
and absence of contamination after pasteurization of milk
might be possible factors for negative samples. This finding
is also supported by Garedew et al. [14], who explained that
by the effectiveness of pasteurization at the processing plant
we can minimize milk contamination to a lower level along
the path from the cow to the pasteurization plant as well as
