This has been attributed to human and agricultural use of antimicrobials. Thus, our study investigated the occurrence and molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance among commensal  $ E.\\ coli $  isolated from selected poultry farms in southwestern Nigeria, an area of the world where little is known on antibiotic use and its contribution to the development and dissemination of resistance. A serious limitation to this study was the difficulty encountered in sample collection which limited the number of isolates included in the study. It was difficult convincing farm owners to participate in the study and most of the volunteer farms restricted access to specified areas of the farms, and none allowed sample collection more than twice. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrated that the commensal  $ E.\\ coli $  included in this study were commonly resistant to antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. However, because our study did not include isolates from farms without antimicrobial use, it was difficult to draw a definite conclusion on the association between drug use on the study farms and the occurrence of resistance in the isolates.",

However, it seemed that local and geographical factors played a role in the occurrence of some resistance genes; all isolates positive for sul3 and tetracycline resistance genes are from Ogbomoso. In a sharp contrast to this, other genes seem to have a widespread occurrence within the study farms. For example, isolates with qnrS originated from six different farms (including the farm admitting usage of fluoroquinolones) and from four different sources: poultry droppings, fish pond sediment and farm soil. The only isolate that did not contain any of the quinolone resistance genes screened for was from well water (EC142). The widespread occurrence of qnrS observed in this study may be a result of their co-selection and transfer with other resistance determinants on mobile genetic elements. qnr, a plasmid-mediated horizontally transferable gene encoding quinolone resistance was discovered for the first time in 1998 and has been in circulation for at least 20 years  $ [27] $ . Qnr proteins are capable of protecting DNA gyrase from the action of quinolones and qnr are increasingly detected in isolates of clinical importance  $ [28] $ . Our findings indicated that qnrS was widely spread among poultry and their production environment in Nigeria. qnrS1 was recently found among Salmonella and E. coli from humans and animal sources in Nigeria  $ [29,13] $ .",
