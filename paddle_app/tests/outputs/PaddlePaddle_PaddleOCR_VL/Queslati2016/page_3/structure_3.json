The pellet was washed twice and DNA was eluted by a centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 1 min then stored at -20 °C until used. The molecular confirmation of Salmonella was carried out by performing a PCR detecting a 1 kb DNA fragment (Karraouan, Fassouane, El Ossmani, Cohen, & Bouchrif, 2010), using specific primers: F-5'ACCACGCTCTTTCGTCTGG3' and R-5GAACTGACTACGTAGACGCTC3' (Abouzeed, Hariharana, Poppe, & Kibengea, 2000). The invasion gene invA and virulence genes spvC and h-li respectively have sizes of 275, 669 and 173 bp (Karraouan et al., 2010). All Salmonella isolated strains were tested for three invasion and virulence genes (invA, h-li and spvC) using three specific primer sets: F-5'TATCGCCACGTTCGGGCAA3' and R-5'TCGCACCGTCCAAAGGAACC3', F-5'AGCCTCGGCTACTGGTCTTG3' and R-5'CCGCAGCAAGAGTCACCTCA3', F-5'CGGAAATACCATCAAA TA3' and R-5'CCCAAACCCATACTTACTCTG3' respectively (Abouzeed et al., 2000).",
