Adelowo _et al. –_ Resistant _E. coli_ from Nigeria _J Infect Dev Ctries_ 2014; 8(9):1103-1112.



None of the eight chloramphenicol resistant isolates,
including those that were negative for _catA1_ and _cmlA_,
were positive for _floR_ . Majority of the tetracycline
resistant isolates did not give positive amplification
signals for most of the tetracycline resistant genes we
tested for.

Even though all positive controls gave positive
amplification signals, _tet_ (C), _tet_ (D) _, tet_ (E), _tet_ (G) or
_tet_ (39) could not be detected among the 29 tetracycline
resistant isolates. However, _tet_ (A) and _tet_ (B) were
found in six (21%) and five (17%) isolates
respectively. Compared to the present study, other
studies reported higher frequencies of _tet_ (A) and
_tet_ (B). For example, in a study of 317 _E. coli_ isolated
from pigs, cattle and poultry in Germany, Guerra _et al._

[15] found _tet_ (A) and _tet_ (B) in 66% and 42% of the
isolates respectively. Similarly, Enne _et al_ [26] found
56% of 103 tetracycline resistant _E. coli_ from farm
animals at slaughter to contain _tet_ (B). _acc(3)-IV,_ the
only gentamicin resistance gene tested for in this study
was not detected in any of the four gentamicin
resistant isolates.

Seven out of eight isolates that were resistant to
ciprofloxacin and had MIC values to nalidixic acid of
≤32 mg/L contained _qnrS._ Of these isolates, the PCR
products of three isolates (EC54, EC143, EC199) were
sequenced and the sequences showed 100% identity to
_qnrS1_ from _E. coli_ (GenBank accession number
GQ214053).


**Discussion**

Development of resistance to antimicrobial agents
is a problem of global proportion which is increasingly
frustrating efforts to treat infectious diseases. This has
been attributed to human and agricultural use of
antimicrobials. Thus, our study investigated the
occurrence and molecular mechanisms of antibiotic
resistance among commensal _E. coli_ isolated from
selected poultry farms in southwestern Nigeria, an area
of the world where little is known on antibiotic use
and its contribution to the development and
dissemination of resistance. A serious limitation to this
study was the difficulty encountered in sample
collection which limited the number of isolates
included in the study. It was difficult convincing farm
owners to participate in the study and most of the
volunteer farms restricted access to specified areas of
the farms, and none allowed sample collection more
than twice. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrated
that the commensal _E. coli_ included in this study were
commonly resistant to antibiotics used in human and
veterinary medicine. However, because our study did



not include isolates from farms without antimicrobial
use, it was difficult to draw a definite conclusion on
the association between drug use on the study farms
and the occurrence of resistance in the isolates.

The observed levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin
(42%) and trimethoprim (47%) were however
unexpected since only one of the eight farms admitted
using the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin and no farm
used trimethoprim. Thus, it is quite possible that use of
trimethoprim, a common component of poultry premixes used widely in the farms of the present study
was underreported. More importantly, our observation
about the levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin and
trimethoprim suggested that factors other than
antibiotic use may be contributing to the selection of
resistance among the present isolates.

Similar to the observed pattern of phenotypic
resistance, genes conferring resistance to
streptomycin/spectinomycin, sulphamethoxazole and
ampicillin were also found to be common among the
isolates. However, it seemed that local and
geographical factors played a role in the occurrence of
some resistance genes; all isolates positive for _sul3_ and
tetracycline resistance genes are from Ogbomoso. In a
sharp contrast to this, other genes seem to have a
widespread occurrence within the study farms. For
example, isolates with _qnrS_ originated from six
different farms (including the farm admitting usage of
fluoroquinolones) and from four different sources:
poultry droppings, fish pond sediment and farm soil.
The only isolate that did not contain any of the
quinolone resistance genes screened for was from well
water (EC142). The widespread occurrence of _qnrS_
observed in this study may be a result of their coselection and transfer with other resistance
determinants on mobile genetic elements. _qnr_, a
plasmid-mediated horizontally transferable gene
encoding quinolone resistance was discovered for the
first time in 1998 and has been in circulation for at
least 20 years [27]. Qnr proteins are capable of
protecting DNA gyrase from the action of quinolones
and _qnr_ are increasingly detected in isolates of clinical
importance [28]. Our findings indicated that _qnrS_ was
widely spread among poultry and their production
environment in Nigeria. _qnrS1_ was recently found
among _Salmonella_ and _E. coli_ from humans and
animal sources in Nigeria [29,13].

Our study provided additional evidence that food
animals production environments may be important
reservoirs of clinically important antibiotic resistance
genes such as plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
(PMQR) genes in this part of the world. This is of
