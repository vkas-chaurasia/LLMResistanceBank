Abstract


Background: Chicken is a rich source of meat protein and is increasingly being consumed in urban areas in Kenya.
However, under poor hygienic environment, raw chicken meat presents an ideal substrate supporting the growth
of pathogenic Escherichia coli and Coliform bacteria indicating the potential presence of other pathogenic bacteria; this
may constitute a major source of food-borne illnesses in humans. This study sought to assess the microbiological
quality and safety of raw chicken meat sold in Nairobi, Kenya by determining the E. coli/coliform contamination levels
as well as the antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogenicity of E. coli isolated.

Findings: We conducted a Cross-sectional study to collect two hundred raw chicken samples that were randomly
purchased between the periods of August 2011-February 2012. Enumeration of bacteria was done using 3 M Petri film
E. coli/Coliform count plates, isolation and identification of E. coli through standard cultural and biochemical testing,
antimicrobial susceptibilities interpreted according to criteria set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(2012) while Polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine presence of virulence genes in isolated E. coli.
Data was analyzed using SPSS version 17.0. Contamination rates were 97% and 78% respectively for Coliform bacteria
and E. coli. Seventy six percent of samples fell under the unacceptable microbial count limit (>100 cfu/ml) and
significant differences in the E. coli/coliform counts (p < 0.001) were observed among the chicken retail outlets
with samples from supermarkets having the lowest level of contamination compared to the rest of the retail outlets.
Seventy five percent of the isolates were resistant to at least one of the 12 antibiotics tested with resistance to tetracycline
being the highest at 60.3%. In addition 40.4% E. coli isolates were positive for the ten virulence genes tested.

Conclusion: Raw retail chicken meats in Nairobi are not only highly contaminated, but also with potentially
pathogenic and multi-drug resistant strains of E. coli. It will be important for public health authorities and retail
chicken processing outlets to collaborate in ensuring adherence to set out principles of hygienic processing and
handling of chicken meats in order to reduce potential risks of infection.

Findings
Background
Ensuring safe food supply has been one of the major
challenges and concerns for producers, consumers and
public health officials in both developing and developed
countries. This is because foods excessively contaminated
with pathogenic and spoilage micro-organism are undesirable and can cause food borne illnesses [1-3]. Such illnesses

cost billions of dollars in medical care and sometimes even
result to death [4]. Several epidemiological reports have
implicated foods from animal origin as major vehicles
associated with illnesses caused by food borne pathogens

[5-7]. Coliform bacteria, especially fecal coliforms, are
good microbial indicators of the potential presence of disease causing bacteria and also show the general sanitary
quality of the food. Food contamination by Escherichia
coli is closely associated with fecal contamination. This is
because E. coli are the most prevalent commensal enteric
bacteria in animals and humans and are also important

zoonotic agents that can be implicated in animal and
human infectious diseases [8].
Raw or undercooked chicken meat is particularly
prone to contamination. The microbiological quality of
chicken meat as purchased by consumers depends mostly
on; the slaughter process, sanitation during processing
and packaging, maintenance of adequate cold chain storage
from the processing to the retail level and to the consumer
and finally sanitation during handling at the retail end

[9-12]. Chicken meat can also act as a reservoir of drug
resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance among E. coli
in food animals such as chicken is of increasing concern
due to the potential for transfer of these resistant pathogens to the human population [13-15].
In urban areas such as Nairobi, marketing of chicken
products is generally undertaken in retail outlets such as
supermarkets, local butcheries located in different geosocio-economic status and even from street vendors in
some low income settings. Public health research in
countries such as the United States of America focusing on food qualities demonstrated that stores in low
socio-economic status populations, because of a higher
prevalence of food safety violations, were shown to be
consistently exposed to food that is of lower microbial
quality. Because of this access pattern, such populations
are placed at increased risk of food-borne illnesses [16,17].
In Kenya, there is a paucity of data on coliform contamination and antimicrobial resistant E. coli in raw retail
chicken supplied to retail outlets in the city. Studies related to antimicrobial resistant E. coli have been done on
isolates from farm animals and chicken carcass samples
from slaughter [18] but not from raw retail chicken which
is made available to consumers. Furthermore, no studies
are available on the contamination levels in chicken meat
available to populations living in different socio-economic
status yet, these data are essential for performing risk
assessment and risk management for food safety. This
study reports on the microbiological quality and safety
of chicken meat available to populations who purchase
from different retail outlets (supermarkets, retail outlets
in high income areas, retail outlets in middle income
areas and retail outlets in low income areas) in the city
of Nairobi.


Methods
Study area and sampling
The study was conducted in Nairobi County. Nairobi is
the administrative and commercial capital in Kenya and
home to thousands of businesses including the retail
chicken business.. There is a huge disparity in income
levels and population densities in Nairobi. The people
living in the western suburbs are generally the more
affluent while the lower and middle-income populations
dominate the eastern suburbs [19].



In a cross-sectional study, chicken samples were randomly purchased from August 2011 to February 2012
from different retail outlets spread over 28 locations in
Nairobi. In order to take into account compounding
factors of socio-economic status within Nairobi, the
retail outlets where samples were purchased were classified into supermarkets, shops from high end areas (low
densely populated, up-market residential suburbs), shops
from middle end areas (middle densely populated areas
further classified into high middle and low middle income
areas) and shops from low end areas (densely populated
slums and informal settings). Classification of locations
into these groups was done based on a study on residential segregation in Nairobi [20]. A total of two hundred
chicken samples (n = 39, supermarkets; n = 39 high end
area retail outlets; n = 84, high middle end area retail outlets; n = 20, low middle end area retail outlets and n = 18,
low end area retail outlets) were purchased. Both freshly
slaughtered as well as samples that have been in storage in
freezers were included in the study. Packaged chicken
samples were transported in cool boxes to the laboratory
for bacterial isolation within 1 hour from time of collection. Samples were processed at the Kenya Medical
Research Institute, Centre for Microbiology Research
laboratories, Kenyatta hospital compound. Ethical approval
to perform this study was obtained from the Ethics Review
Committee at Kenya Medical Research Institute, Reference
SSC No. 2036.


Bacteriological analysis
Enumeration of E. coli and coliform bacteria from the
chicken samples was performed as described in the
Association of Analytical Communities International,
official methods of analysis using 3 M petrifilm E. coli/
Coliform count plates [21] with slight modification.
The samples, which included the skin of the chicken
along with the meat itself, were aseptically removed
from the package and 100 gram piece of chicken was
weighed and placed in 100 ml sterile distilled water.
One ml of the rinse water from the sample was placed
onto the center of the bottom film and covered carefully
avoiding entrapment of air bubbles and the plates from all
samples incubated for 24 ± 2 hrs at 35°C. Colony counts
for each petrifilm were done the following day and the microbial count results converted to the base 10 logarithm
of the number of colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml)
rinse water obtained from the samples. Typical E. coli
colonies growing on the petrifilm were then selected
and sub-cultured in MacConkey agar to obtain pure
colonies. After a series of biochemical tests for confirmative identification [22], positive E. coli isolates were stored
at −80°C in trypticase soy broth for further antimicrobial
susceptibility tests and PCR to determine the presence of
virulence genes.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method [23], E. coli
were tested for their susceptibility to 12 commonly
used antimicrobials on disks containing; Ampicillin
(AMP 10 μg), Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (AMC, 30 μg),
Tetracycline (TE 30 μg), sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprin
(SXT 30 μg), Ciprofloxacin (CIP 5 μg), Ceftriaxone (CRO
30 μg), Ceftazidime (CAZ 30 μg), Kanamycin (K 30 μg),
Streptomycin (S 10 μg), Gentamicin (CN 10 μg), Nalidixic
acid (NA 30 μg) and Chloramphenicol (C 30 μg). The
concentrations of the antimicrobial disks were selected
based on the internationally recognized standards and
guidelines on antimicrobial routine testing and reporting
on enterobacteriaceae provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute. E. coli strain 25922 was used
to control for bacterial growth and potency of antibiotic
disks. Inoculated agar plates were incubated at 37°C for
24 h. The susceptibility zones were also measured and
interpreted according to criteria set by the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute [24].


Bacterial DNA extraction and detection of virulence genes
in E. coli
DNA from the isolated E. coli as well as from 5 control
strains was extracted following the procedures described
by Ehrt and Schnappinger [25], with slight modifications.
A loop full of overnight bacterial culture was suspended
in 1 ml of sterile distilled water and then boiled for
10 minutes at 95°C. The cell mixture was centrifuged for
5 minutes at 14,000 rpm and supernatant was used as
the DNA template for PCR amplification. Ten PCR
primers were used to detect the target genes enumerating toxins in pathogenic E. coli [26]. A multiplex PCR
system was optimized by the progressive incorporation
of primers corresponding to the different genes and several combinations of melting temperatures, primer concentrations and DNA template concentration. PuReTaq
ready to go PCR beads (GE Health care) were used for
PCR. The total reaction volume in each PCR tube was
25 μl containing 3 μl template DNA, 2 μl primer (0.2 μl
of each primer) and 20 μ sterile PCR water. PCR was
done under the following conditions; initial denaturation
at 94°C for 5 minutes. This was followed by 35 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 1 minute, annealing at 56°C for
30 seconds and extension at 72°C for 1 minute. The final
step was amplification at 72°C for 10 minutes. Amplicons were then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis
and viewed under UV light.


Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis including means, medians and standard
deviations, was conducted by means of SPSS version 17.0
software. To determine differences in microbial counts in
chicken samples purchased from among the various retail



outlets, ANOVA was used after converting the counts to
base 10 logarithms. The chi-square test was used to assess
any statistical significant association between antimicrobial resistances in the E. coli isolated with regard
to retail outlet classification from where the raw chicken
was purchased.


Results
Contamination rate and microbial count in raw retail
chicken
Contamination rate of chicken samples by total coliform
bacteria was found to be 97% while contamination by E.
coli was 78%. The average E. coli and coliform counts
for all samples in general were observed to be above the
acceptable range for E. coli counts as set by the Hazard
Analysis and Critical Control Point system (HACCP),
developed by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
and adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission
(3.911 and 5.0261Log10cfu/ml respectively). According
to this system, the acceptable food safety range is
100 cfu/ml or less (2.000 Log10cfu/ml or less), the marginal or intermediate range is over 100 cfu/ml but not
above 1000 cfu/ml (over 2.000 but not above 3.000
Log10cfu/ml) and the unacceptable range is above
1000 cfu/ml (above 3.000 Log10cfu/ml) [27]. Only 80
(40%) out of a total 200 retail chicken samples that were
purchased fell under the acceptable range for E. coli
counts. 76% of samples fell under the unacceptable
range for total coliforms. As shown in Tables 1 and 2 supermarkets had the highest percentage of samples within
acceptable food safety ranges while average counts of samples from the rest of the retail outlets were within marginal or unacceptable counts of above 2.000 Log10cfu/ml.
There was a statistical significant difference in the E. coli
count (F (4,175) =16.676; MSE = 106.576; p < 0.001)
and coliform counts (F (4,179) =18.37; MSE = 105.097;
p < 0.001) among the outlets with supermarkets having
the lowest E. coli and coliform count compared to the
rest. Graphical evidence of the differences of E. coli
and coliform counts observed in the different retail
outlet classifications are also shown in Figures 1 and 2.


Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant E. coli isolated from
raw retail chicken
Seventy five percent (117 out 156) of the E. coli isolated
exhibited resistance to at least one of the 12 antibiotics
tested. As seen in Table 3, prevalence of antimicrobial
resistance was highest for tetracycline followed by
sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprin, ampicillin and streptomycin. Only 24.5% of the isolates were fully sensitive to all
antibiotics while 42.9% were resistant to 3 or more antibiotics especially to the above mentioned antimicrobials.
There was no significant difference in the prevalence of
antimicrobial resistance among the 5 classifications of

retail outlets (χ [2] n-1 = 4.178; d.f = 4; p = 0.382). However,
samples from supermarkets had the highest prevalence
(84.6%) while samples from outlets in low income areas
had the lowest prevalence of antimicrobial resistance
(62.5%).


Prevalence of E. coli isolates harboring virulence markers
Of the E. coli isolated from raw retail chicken meat,
40.4% carried at least one of 10 virulence genes tested
and specific for 5 known diarrheagenic E. coli. Of the E.
coli positive for virulence genes in this study, ETEC was
the most common pathogenic E. coli (61%) while the
least common was EAggEC (5%) (Table 4).


Conclusion
The E. coli contamination rate observed in this study
was almost similar to that observed in studies conducted
in other developing countries. For instance, contamination rates of 98% were observed in the north east part
of India, 100% in Cameroon and 100% in Vietnam

[28-30]. Similar high recovery rates have been observed
in studies from developed countries with contamination
rates as high as 100% in Japan, 89% Minnesota, U.S.A,



and 90% in two states in Australia [31-34]. Similarly,
studies in Hanoi, Vietnam, Morocco and some states in
America have shown that the percentage of retail chicken
samples which fall under the unacceptable food safety
range were also high and that perishable produce items,
including poultry, available in markets in low-socio economic status census tracts had higher microbial indicator
counts compared to markets in high-socio economic
status due to a higher prevalence of food safety violations

[30,35-37,16,17]. The results observed in this study might
be due to factors common in Nairobi such as home
slaughter of chicken by small scale poultry producers
instead of slaughter at private or municipal government
approved chicken slaughter houses thus increasing the
potential risks for contamination due to bio-security flaws

[13]. All samples from supermarkets and a majority of
samples from high income butcheries were products of
government approved private chicken slaughter houses.
Majority of carcasses in Nairobi tend to be lumped
together in one large container or sack as they are being
transported in ambient temperature thus exposing them
to the open air as well as allowing transfer of contaminants
from one carcass to another and subsequent microbial

multiplication. Studies in Iran and Switzerland showed that
there were significant differences in contamination rates
between individually packed and unpacked chicken meat
samples [38,39]. Use of freezers and cooling temperatures
for storage and display in some outlets from high middle
income and low income areas could have resulted to few
samples falling under the acceptable food safety range in
these outlets as seen from the outliers in Figure 1 [40,41].
In most retail outlets, the degree of physical contact
between different kinds of meat on display such as beef,
fish and mutton may have led to cross contamination of
different meats. Also, use of bare hands in handling meat,
utensils and money at the same time as observed may
have increased chances of microbial contamination [42].
In contrast to the findings in this study, a similar recent

study in Accra, Ghana found that even though hygienic
conditions in supermarkets were generally better than
those in local markets and farms, there was no significant
difference between the microbial counts for these retail
outlets and they all had low microbial counts [43]. The authors attributed this observation to the deliberate efforts
by the food sector in improving the hygienic procedures
in the processing of poultry over the years.

Similar prevalence of antibiotic resistance in E. coli
isolated from retail chicken have been observed in other
studies ranging from 40.6% in Japan, 52% in Iceland,
84.6% in Minneapolis, U.S.A, 83.8% in Vietnam and even
100% isolates in Senegal being resistant to one or more
antibiotics [31,44-47]. The high prevalence of resistance
in poultry meat isolates is alarming given the evidence of
possible transmission of antibiotic resistant food borne
bacteria to consumers and food handlers [48]. Similar
multi-drug resistance phenotypes of E. coli isolated from
retail chicken have been reported in studies conducted
in Japan, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Slovakia [30,31,49,50].
The common resistance phenotypes observed are of
great clinical significance since these antimicrobials
are considered to be among the frontline therapeutic
drugs for treatment of most bacterial infections in

humans in Kenya. Past studies assessing antimicrobial
consumption in food producing animals in Kenya showed
that tetracyclines, sulphonamides and trimethoprins,
nitrofurans, aminoglycosides, beta lactams and the
quinolones were the most commonly used drugs in
food producing animals with tetracyclines and sulphonamides/trimethoprin topping the list in popularity
and accounting for nearly 78% of the use [51]. A corresponding study in Tanzania showed similar results supporting these findings [52]. Such use has been shown
to result in the development of resistant bacteria which
can then reach heavily exposed individuals such as
slaughter house workers, food handlers and farmers
who feed the animals with the antimicrobials [53].
These resistant bacteria can then easily contaminate
the carcasses of food animals along the production line
to the retail outlets. In countries such as Uganda and
Iceland, studies have shown that broiler chicken production has been associated with a high prevalence of
antimicrobial resistance in isolates from these chickens
due to consumption of antimicrobials [54,55]. In this
study, all samples from supermarkets, which had more
resistant isolates, came from improved breeds of
chicken/broilers while 80% of samples from low income areas were from local/indigenous chicken breeds.
A common practice for broiler chicken producers in
urban areas in Kenya is to add antibiotics into the
commercial feeds or drinking water for chicken thus
exposing them more to undue antimicrobial consumption [56]. This practice may modify the intestinal flora
and create a selective pressure in favor of resistant
bacteria [57]. On the other hand, indigenous chicken
production in most African countries including Kenya
is traditionally based on free range breeding systems
allowing birds to grow without any external influence.
They are estimated to reach a mature, marketable age
by 8 months [42,58].
Studies done in Burkina Faso, Korea and Lebanon also
showed presence of E. coli contaminants harboring virulence genes in fresh poultry meat (with prevalence of
43%, 14% and 14% respectively) and that that ETEC,
EPEC and STEC were the most common diarrheagenic
E. coli detected [59-61]. This could be because ETEC,
EPEC and STEC are much frequently implicated in
various food and water borne diseases and they are
known contaminants of meat and meat products [62,63].
Studies, for instance in Canada, Spain and Minnesota
U.S.A, have also shown that live chicken and other
food animals are known reservoirs of these pathogenic
E. coli and therefore contamination could actually be
from the animal during evisceration or even from
water used during their processing [64-66]. On the
other hand EIEC and EaggEC are not implicated much
in food and water borne illnesses and there are no



known animal reservoirs for these pathogens hence any
primary source of contamination appears to be infected
humans [63,67]. Another reason for this observation in
this study is that ETEC had several virulent gene markers
compared to the rest and thus could be easily detected
more than the others. These results are important as they
indicate that apart from being highly contaminated with
coliforms which could lead to quick spoilage, raw retail
chicken in Nairobi, Kenya is a potential source of food
borne illnesses as it carries pathogenic E. coli. This has
important implications and present unique challenges for
interventions for microbial contamination of retail chicken
meats in urban settings.
