The use of antibiotics in farm management (growing crops and raising animals)
has become a major area of concern. Its implications is the consequent
emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and accordingly their access
into the human food chain with passage of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) to
the normal human intestinal microbiota and hence to other pathogenic bacteria
causative human disease. Therefore, we pursued in this study to unravel the
frequency and the quinolone resistance determining region, mecA and cfr genes
of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) and methicillinsusceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCNS) isolated from the retail trade of
ready-to-eat raw chicken meat samples collected during 1 year and sold across the Great
Cairo area. The 50 Staphylococcus isolated from retail raw chicken meat were analyzed
for their antibiotic resistance phenotypic profile on 12 antibiotics (penicillin, oxacillin,
methicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, gentamicin,
ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin) and
their endorsement of the quinolone resistance determining region, mecA and cfr genes.
The isolation results revealed 50 isolates, CPS (14) and CNS (36), representing ten
species (S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. epidermedius, S. lugdunensis, S. haemolyticus,
S. hominus, S. schleiferi, S. cohnii, S. intermedius, and S. lentus). Twenty seven
isolates were methicillin-resistant. Out of the characterized 50 staphylococcal isolates,
three were MRSA but only 2/3 carried the mecA gene. The ARG that bestows
resistance to quinolones, β-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin
B [MLS(B)] in MRSA and MR-CNS were perceived. According to the available
literature, the present investigation was a unique endeavor into the identification
