In contrast, all the isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftiofuro, cefotaxime, colistin, florfenicol and apramycin. Among the 15 ciprofloxacin resistant isolates, eight isolates had MICs to nalidixic acid  $ \\leq $  32 mg/L. While this study was not designed to investigate the relationship between antibiotic use and resistance on the study farms due primarily to the non-availability of antibiotic-use information as mentioned earlier, it is important to report that tetracycline, streptomycin, sulphonamides, and ampicillin are among the antimicrobials used on all the study farms.",

The variable region of the class 1 integrons of one representative isolate (EC117) selected from among the most common sized amplicon (1500 bp found in four isolates) was partially sequenced (935 bp). The partial sequence showed 99% sequence identity with position 695 to 1629 containing aadA5 in E. coli GL1 (GenBank accession number FJ807902). As expected, the sulphonamide resistance gene sul1 was detected in all class 1 integron-positive isolates as part of the integron. The variable regions of the class 2 integrons detected among the int2 positive isolates showed three different sized PCR products. The product of one representative isolate (EC3, EC111 and EC113) for each type was sequenced. The partial sequences showed 88% identity with position 1057 to 436 of E. coli encoding a sat1 (GenBank accession number X56815) for isolate EC111, 100% identity with position 2073 to 2608 of E. coli encoding a dfrA1-sat2(partial) (GenBank accession number HM439239) for EC113 and 100% identity with position 1995 to 2668 of E. coli encoding a sat2 (GenBank accession number AY183453) for isolate EC3.",
