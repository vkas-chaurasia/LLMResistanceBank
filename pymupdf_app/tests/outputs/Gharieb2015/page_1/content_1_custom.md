**Abstract**
**Background:** The worldwide increase of food-borne infections with antibiotic resistant pathogens constitutes a
major public health problem. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence, antibiogram, virulence genes
profiles and integron characteristics of non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ spp. isolated from poultry meat and diarrhoeic
patients in Egypt.
**Methods:** A total of 150 samples comprising (100 poultry meat and 50 diarrhoeic patients’ stool) were examined for
the presence of _Salmonella_ spp. using culture methods followed by biochemical and serological identification of the
isolates. All _Salmonella_ strains were tested for their susceptibility to the antibiotics using disk diffusion method and
screened for the presence of virulence genes and class I integrons using PCR.
**Results:** The overall prevalence of _Salmonella_ spp. in poultry meat samples was 10 % compared to 4 % in diarrhoeic
patients. All the isolates were serologically identified into _Salmonella_ Typhimurium (seven isolates), _S._ Derby, _S._ Kiel,
_S._ Rubislaw (one isolate, each) and untypable strains (two isolates). Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed a higher
resistance of the total isolates to erythromycin and tetracycline (100 %, each), followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
(91.7 %), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83.3 %), streptomycin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam (75 %, each), gentamycin, ampicillin (66.7 %, each), chloramphenicol (58.3 %), ciprofloxacin (25 %) and ceftriaxone (16.7 %). Virulence
genes profiles revealed the presence of _sop_ B gene in five _Salmonella_ strains isolated from poultry meat (n = 3) and
humans (n = 2). Moreover, _pef_ A was only identified in three isolates from poultry meat. On the other hand, _S._ Kiel and
_S._ Typhimurium (one isolate, each) were harboring _hilA_ and _stn_ genes, respectively. Class 1 integrons were detected in
all _Salmonella_ spp. with variable amplicon sizes ranged from 650–3000 bp. Sequencing of these amplicons revealed
the presence of gene cassettes harboring _aac(3)_  - _Id_, _aadA2_, _aadA4_, _aadA7_, _sat_, _dfrA15_, _lnuF_ and _estX_ resistance genes.
Nucleotide sequence analysis showed point mutations in the _aac(3)_  - _Id_ of _S._ Derby, _aadA2_, _estX_  - _sat_ genes of _S._ Typhimurium. Meanwhile, frame shift mutation was observed in _aad_ A7 genes of _S._ Typhimurium.
**Conclusions:** Increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance and class 1 integrons among multidrug resistant _Salmonella_
spp. has prompted calls for the reduction of antimicrobial use in livestock to prevent future emergence of resistance.
