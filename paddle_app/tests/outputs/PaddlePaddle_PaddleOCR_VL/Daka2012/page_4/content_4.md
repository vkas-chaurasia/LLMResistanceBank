bacteria in milk relates to poor hygiene practices. Based on observations made during the collection of samples, we therefore report that improper hygiene and poor farm management practices contributed to the presence of S. aureus in the milk, especially in those from the Hawassa area. In this study area milk was obtained from animals by washing their hands and/or the utensils and containers used. In certain cases, untreated groundwater was used to wash the containers that were used for milking. This may have contributed to the high level of S. aureus isolated. Improving the hygienic conditions of the milking environment and/or utensils may reduce the prevalence of S. aureus in milk and prevent its transmission to humans.

A further objective of the study was to characterize and compare the antibiotic-resistance profiles of S. aureus isolated from the study area. The motivation for this was the fact that there were no clear studies conducted in the area. Furthermore, the presence of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus has been reported to negatively affect the

treatment of its associated infections in humans and animals  $ [12,15,23] $ . We therefore believe that an investigation of the antibiotic-resistance profiles of these isolates may serve as a tool in assessing both the sanitary conditions employed during milking and the health risks that humans may encounter when infected by antibiotic-resistant strains.

PG (10  $ \mu $ g), AP (10  $ \mu $ g) and Ox (1  $ \mu $ g) were the drugs to which a large proportion of the isolates were resistant (Table 4). As shown in Table 4, between 60.0% and 67.9% of the isolates from all CCP levels were resistant to these three drugs. Also VA (30  $ \mu $ g), AC (30  $ \mu $ g), E (15  $ \mu $ g) and CRO (30  $ \mu $ g) were resistance to S. aureus about 38.5%, 32.1%, 30.8% and 23.5% respectively. None of the S. aureus were resistance to CIP (5  $ \mu $ g). However, very small proportions of S. aureus were resistance to TMP-SMX (25  $ \mu $ g) (7.7%). Contrarily to our observations, a study reported that larger percentage (15.7% to 19%) of S. aureus isolated was resistant to TMP-SMX (25  $ \mu $ g) [28]. The finding that a large number of S. aureus were resistant to PG (10  $ \mu $ g), AP (10  $ \mu $ g) and Ox (1  $ \mu $ g) is, however, a cause for concern and should be further investigated. It is thus our view that the results obtained in this study do not accurately reflect the usage of this antibiotic on farms. We cannot explain this phenomenon.

CIP (5  $ \mu $ g) resistance was almost non-existent in the all CCP levels of the isolates. Also no resistance S. aureus strain was isolated from immediate pasteurized milk for AC (30  $ \mu $ g), E (15  $ \mu $ g), CRO (30  $ \mu $ g), TMP-SMX (25  $ \mu $ g) and CIP (5  $ \mu $ g). Despite the fact that a significantly larger
