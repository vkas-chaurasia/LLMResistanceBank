The eight farms included in the study were selected from Ogbomoso and Ibadan in Oyo State ( $ 8^{\\circ}0' $  N  $ 4^{\\circ}0' $  E) and Osogbo in Osun State ( $ 7^{\\circ}46' $  N  $ 4^{\\circ}34' $  E) of Southwestern Nigeria. The farms are those who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study and are described in Table 1. Among the farms, only one has a comprehensive record of drug usage, it was also the only farm that admitted using enrofloxacin. The remaining farms admitted using one or more of furazolidone, furaltadone, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, neomycin, streptomycin, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin regularly on the farms for animal health management. The drugs are usually part of formulations used as feed supplements, commonly referred to as “premix” which often contained mixtures of antimicrobials. The farm with combined aquaculture operation suspended aquaculture operations about 5 months before the period of sediment collection from the fish pond.",
