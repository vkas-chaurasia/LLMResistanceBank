and centrifuged for 5 min. at 13,400 rpm (miniSpin,
Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). 500 µl chloroform/
isoamyl alcohol (24:1 vol/vol) was added to the aqueous
phase, mixed and centrifuged for 5 min. at 13,400 rpm.
DNA from the aqueous phase was precipitated by mixing with 0.6 volume of isopropanol at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded
and the DNA was air dried and finally dissolved in 50 µl
10 mM Tris (Carl Roth GmbH).


**Multiplex PCR for identification of** _**Campylobacter**_ **species**
A mPCR assay was used to identify thermophilic
_Campylobacter_ species ( _C. jejuni_, _C. coli_, and _C. lari_ ) as
described by El-Adawy et al. [26]. Briefly, the PCR was
performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 5.0 μl
of 10 × _Taq_ reaction buffer complete (Jena Bioscience
GmbH, Jena, Germany), 2.0 μl of dNTP mix (2 mM
each; Carl Roth GmbH), 2.0 μl of each primer (Jena
Bioscience GmbH), and 0.2 μl of _Taq_ Pol thermostable
DNA polymerase (Jena Bioscience GmbH). Amplification reactions were carried out in a TRIO Thermoblock
cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) using the following programme: one cycle of 1 min at 96 °C was
followed by 35 cycles each consisting of 60 s at 95 °C
of denaturation, 90 s at 59 °C of annealing, and 60 s at
72 °C of elongation. The PCR was terminated after a final
extension step of 5 min. at 72 °C. Amplification generated 857, 589, 522, and 462 base pair DNA fragments
specific for the genus _Campylobacter_ and the species _C._
_jejuni_, _C. lari_, and _C. coli_, respectively. For analysis, 20 μl
of PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a
1.5 % agarose gel for 1 h, stained with ethidium bromide
(0.5 μg/ml), and visualized under UV light. Results were
documented using BioImage system GeneGenius (Syngene, Synoptics Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Reference strains
_C. jejuni_ DSM 4688, _C. coli_ DSM 4689, and _C. lari_ DSM
11375 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) were used
as positive controls.


**Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and determination**
**of MICs**
The antimicrobial susceptibility of _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli_
isolates was tested against seven antibiotic agents (chloramphenicol, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic
acid, gentamicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline) using
the Sensititre [™] Campylobacter plates—EUCAMP (Trek
Diagnostic Systems Ltd., East Grinstead, UK). The MIC
values were detected using different concentration ranges
as previously described [23]. Briefly, _Campylobacter_ isolates grown on Mueller–Hinton agar (Oxoid GmbH)
supplemented with 10 % bovine blood under microaerophilic conditions were suspended in NaCl solution



(0.9 %) to obtain a turbidity corresponding to a McFarland standard of 0.5 (Dr. Lange, CADAS photometer
30, Berlin, Germany). One-hundred and fifty milliliters
of the above suspension were diluted with 10 ml Mueller–Hinton broth (Oxoid GmbH) resulting in a concentration of approximately 10 [6] –10 [7] colony forming units
(cfu)/ml. One hundred milliliters of the inoculum was
filled in each well of the plate; the plates were sealed
and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under microaerophilic
conditions. Results were read either visually or photometrically (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim,
Germany) using the computer program easyWIN fitting (version V6.1, 2000). _C. jejuni_ DSM 4688 and _C. coli_
DSM 4689 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen
und Zellkulturen GmbH) were included in each batch of
broth microdilution assay for quality control. The lowest
concentration of antibiotics that prevents visible growth
of the microorganism is defined as the MIC.


**Molecular biological detection of antibiotic resistance**
**determinants**
Extracted _Campylobacter_ DNA from all samples and
strains was used for molecular biological determination
of selected antibiotic resistance determinants by PCR.


**Erythromycin resistance**
Detection of mutations at positions 2074 and 2075 in
domain V of the 23S rRNA gene, which mediates resistance to erythromycin, was carried out by MAMA–PCR
and PCR–RFLP as described previously [21, 24]. Genes
responsible for resistance of erythromycin and ciprofloxacin were tested at two loci using MAMA–PCR and
PCR–RFLP. Primers and their sequences are given in
Table 1.


**Ciprofloxacin resistance**
A single point mutation (Thr-86-Ile) in the quinolone
resistance-determining region (QRDR) of _gyr_ A gene
was defined as source of high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones [23]. MAMA–PCR for _C. jejuni_ isolates was
carried out as described previously [27], for _C. coli_ a procedure according to Zirnstein et al. [28] was used. Primer
details are given in Table 1.


**Tetracycline resistance**
Primers DMT1 and DMT2 (Jena Bioscience GmbH) were
used for the detection of the _tet_ (O) gene which is strongly
associated with tetracycline resistance in _C. jejuni_ and _C._
_coli_ as described previously [29]. As a second gene locus
associated with tetracycline resistance the presence of
_tet_ (A) was examined by a previously described PCR assay

[22]. An alternative, in-house validated PCR assay was
created based on _tet_ (A) sequences (GenBank acc. no.
