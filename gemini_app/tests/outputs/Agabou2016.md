## Abstract

The objectives of this study were to determine rates, patterns, and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and to assess connections between chicken commensal, human commensal, and pathogenic ciprofloxacin-resistant *Escherichia coli* isolates. All *E. coli* isolates collected from chickens, their farmers, and patients in the Constantine region (North-east Algeria) were analyzed for *bla* and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene contents, phylogroups, Rep-PCR profiles, and multilocus sequence types.

A high prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones (51.4% to ciprofloxacin) was recorded in avian isolates. Of these, 22.2% carried the *aac(6')-Ib-cr* gene, whereas lower resistance levels to these antibiotics were recorded in chicken farmers' isolates. None of the commensal isolates harbored the *qnr*, *qepA*, or *oqxAB* genes. One human pathogenic isolate was ertapenem-resistant and harbored the *blaOXA-48* gene, 84 showed an extended-spectrum -lactamase phenotype, with *blaCTX-M-15* gene prevalent in 87.2% of them. Seventy isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, with *aac(6')-Ib-cr* present in 72.8%, *qnrB* in 5.7%, and *qnrS* in 10%.

Three Rep-PCR profiles were common to chicken commensal and human pathogenic isolates (phylogroups D and B1; ST21, ST48, and ST471 respectively); one was found in both chicken and chicken-farmer commensal strains (D; ST108), while another profile was identified in a chicken-farmer commensal strain and a human pathogenic one (B1; ST19). These findings suggest clonal and epidemiologic links between chicken and human ciprofloxacin-resistant *E. coli* isolates and the important role that poultry may play in the epidemiology of human *E. coli* infections in the Constantine region.

## Introduction

*Escherichia coli* are commensal bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many animal species. However, some strains are pathogenic and frequently encountered in clinical practice. In poultry production, colibacillosis (caused by avian pathogenic *E. coli*: APEC) continues to be a devastating disease all over the world. Antimicrobial therapy is an important tool to reduce both the incidence of this pathology and its economic impact. Nevertheless, used therapeutically or given subtherapeutically as feed additives, antibiotics seem to have a profound impact on the development of antibiotic resistance in commensal bacteria, which are potential genetic partners in the transfer of resistance genes to pathogenic ones.

Over many years, the multiplication of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in animals has become a major concern in both animal and public health, as resistant bacteria can pass through the food chain to people. In several surveys, the use of antibiotics in animal production has been held responsible for the increase of rebellious human infections due to resistant bacteria. The association between deficiency in new marketed antibiotics and accelerated evolution of bacterial resistance in both animals and humans represents a real "emergency", and is more considered as an ecosystem problem, especially for commensal microfloras.

Many studies have demonstrated that some APEC strains could belong to the same clones as human extraintestinal pathogenic ones (ExPEC), and may act as potential pathogens for humans as they often possess similar virulence genes. However, few studies have been investigating the relationship between avian non-clinical bacteria and human pathogenic ones. The present study was designed to assess in detail rates, patterns, and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in chicken commensal, human commensal, and pathogenic *E. coli* strains in the Constantine region (North-East of Algeria), and to evaluate the connection between them.

## Material and methods

### Chicken and chicken farmers' commensal isolates

Fourteen independent farms keeping chicken flocks (A to N, aged 35 days or more) from various regions of Constantine were randomly enrolled from March 2011 through December 2012. On each farm, a mixture of 20 fresh poultry droppings was collected as well as a stool sample from a consenting chicken farmer. At the laboratory, samples were diluted and cultured on MacConkey agar (BioMerieux, France). Suspected colonies were identified using the API 20E system (BioMérieux) and from each sample five *E. coli* colonies were arbitrarily selected for antibiotic susceptibility testing. The following information was also recorded: flock size, age, health status and antibiotics used for birds, other animals kept at the farm, recent hospital stay and antibiotics taken by poultry farmers, their family members, or their companion animals during the last 3 months.

### Human pathogenic isolates

We selected 94 (consecutive non-repetitive) human pathogenic *E. coli* isolates obtained from various clinical samples and collected from different wards of the Military Hospital of Constantine from March 2011 to December 2012. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected for each patient.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and ESBL detection

All isolates were subjected to susceptibility testing against 31 selected antibiotics important in clinical practice by the disc diffusion method. Results were interpreted according to the SFM/EUCAST recommendations. ESBL-production was screened by the double-disk synergy test and fluoroquinolones-resistant isolates were selected for further molecular analyses.

### Characterization of -lactamase-encoding and PMQR genes

Plasmid or chromosomal DNA was extracted from the isolates using the EZ1 DNA Tissue kit on the BioRobot EZ1 extraction platform (QIAGEN, France). Genes encoding for the most clinically prevalent carbapenemases (*blaKPC*, *blaOXA-48-like*, *blaVIM*, *blaIMP*, and *blaNDM*) and ESBLs (*blaTEM*, *blaSHV* and *blaCTX-M*) were detected by PCR and confirmed by sequencing the PCR products. Similarly, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes (*qnrA*, *qnrB*, *qnrS*, *qepA*, *aac(6')-Ib-cr*, and *oqxAB*) were screened and confirmed (by PCR and sequencing) in all the quinolone-resistant isolates.

### Phylotyping and O25b subgrouping

Phylogenetic groups of the *E. coli* isolates and the O25b subgroup of the ESBL-producers were determined by PCR as previously described.

### Clonality analysis

The genetic relationship of all the human and avian ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates was studied using Rep-PCR (DiversiLab system, BioMérieux). Isolates with identical patterns were considered indistinguishable if their similarity percentage was  95%.

### MLST

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was carried out by PCR amplification and sequencing of eight housekeeping genes: *dinB*, *icdA*, *pabB*, *polB*, *putP*, *trpA*, *trpB*, and *uidA*. Allelic profile and sequence type determinations were assigned according to the Institut Pasteur's MLST web site scheme.

## Results

### Drug resistance profiles and phylogenetic grouping in chicken commensal *E. coli*

The resistance phenotypes confirmed that among the 70 avian commensal *E. coli*, 44.3% (belonging to all flocks except B and F) were resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes. Resistance levels to nalidixic acid (88.6%), ofloxacin (80%) and ciprofloxacin (51.4%) were very frequent, and all the strains were susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins and many other antibiotics (Table 1). Among the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates (n=36) none harbored *qnr*, *qepA*, or *oqxAB* genes, but 22.2% of them carried the *aac(6')-Ib-cr* gene. These isolates were distributed among the four main phylogenetic groups: B1 (41.7%), D (30.6%), A (25%), and B2 (2.7%).

### Drug resistance profiles and phylogenetic grouping in chicken farmers commensal *E. coli*

These isolates showed lower resistance levels to nalidixic acid (15.7%), ofloxacin (11.4%), and ciprofloxacin (5.7%), and all were susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins and other drugs (Table 1). None of the chicken farmers was treated with antibiotics, and 64.3% of them had pets. Half of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were collected from farmers who did not use these drugs for their poultry. These isolates harboured no PMQR genes. They belonged to phylogroups A (25%), B1 (25%), and D (50%), and were isolated in poultry farms B, D, F, and N.

### Drug resistance profiles and phylogenetic grouping in human pathogenic *E. coli*

Among the 94 clinical isolates, one exhibited resistance to ertapenem (1.1%), 84 (89.4%) showed an ESBL phenotype, and 70 (74.5%) were insensitive to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to antibiotics was significantly more prevalent in clinical isolates than in farmers or poultry isolates (22/31 antibiotics tested), in particular to ciprofloxacin (p<0.001) (Table 1).

The ertapenem-resistant strain harboured the *blaOXA-48* gene in association with *blaTEM-1* and *aac(6')-Ib-cr*. Among the 84 ESBL-producers, 82 harboured the *blaCTX-M-15* gene and the two remaining strains carried *blaTEM-24* and *blaTEM-3*. These ESBLs were significantly associated with strains isolated from patients (p<0.001). Co-resistance to ciprofloxacin was shown by 78.1% of the *blaCTX-M-15*+ isolates. The *aac(6')-Ib-cr* gene was identified in 51 ciprofloxacin-resistant strains (72.9%), *qnrS* in seven (10%) and *qnrB* in five (7.1%).

### Clonality analysis and MLST of ciprofloxacin-resistant *E. coli* strains

The obtained dendrogram showed that the 110 fluoroquinolones-resistant isolates were grouped in 38 Rep-PCR patterns. Only seven profiles included five or more isolates. Three clonal groups (VI, X, and XXXI) connected chicken commensal isolates to human pathogenic ones. One pattern (XXX) was common to chicken and chicken-farmer commensal strains (D; ST108), and another (I) was identified in a chicken-farmer commensal strain and a human pathogenic one (B1; ST19).

## Discussion

The findings of the present study provide evidence of a genetic homogeneity and a clonal link between *E. coli* from poultry, farmers, and clinical cases in the Constantine region, suggesting that avian commensal, human commensal, and pathogenic strains are from the same origin. Chicken-to-human transmission of bacteria during farming has been largely demonstrated. *E. coli* strains could also be transmitted from poultry to humans through meat consumption and environmental contamination with manure or faeces of wild or domestic birds.

Another route of antimicrobial-resistant *E. coli* entry into the community is through occupational exposure to *E. coli* from live-animal contact in the broiler chicken industry. This had been confirmed by our findings, as we observed clonality between chicken and chicken farmers' strains, and between the latter and human pathogenic ones.

Interestingly, we did not find any correlation between the most important worldwide drug-resistant and virulent *E. coli* O25:H4-B2-ST131 clone (mainly responsible for urinary tract infections) and any avian strains. The fact that a big number of our ExPEC isolates belong to clusters exclusive to humans suggests that most of human pathogenic strains may not be derived from extra-human (avian) ones. However, the clonality among several avian and human isolates supports the idea of their evolution from a recent common ancestor.
