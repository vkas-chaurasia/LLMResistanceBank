ANTIBIOGRAM AND PLASMID PROFILES OF _SALMONELLA_ 1181



The study of the antimicrobial resistance performed
on 100 _Salmonella_ strains revealed a resistance to 8
of them from 6 different classes. Fifty-three percent
of the strains showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial, among which 15.09% were multiresistant.
Forty-seven percent of strains were susceptible to all
antimicrobials tested. The resistance to quinolones was
the most frequent (58.49%) and included 94.74% of the
resistant strains of the prevalent serotype in our study
(Table 2). The plasmid transfer assay was performed
on 53 strains with resistance to β-lactams (4%), aminoglycosides (2%), tetracyclines (15%), sulphonamides
(13%), nitrofurans (19%), and to quinolones (47%). In
total, 11 strains have transferred one or several resistance markers, of which the most frequent were ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, sulphonamides, and
kanamycin. The tetracycline character was present in
72.72% of transconjugants, those of the sulphonamides
and β-lactams in 27.27% each, and that of the aminoglycosides in 9.09%. The compatibility test revealed
incompatibility groups of plasmids in Com1 and F1me
classes (Table 3). The plasmid DNA analysis resulted
in a molecular weight that is greater than 100 kb (Figure 1).


**DISCUSSION**

_**Geographical Distribution**_
_**of Salmonella Serotypes**_

Bouira was characterized by the most important
number of isolated strains because most avian samples
were from this region, which has more than one-thousand poultry farms. _Salmonella_ Heidelberg prevailed in
our study. Our results were supported by the study
of Barnhart et al. (1991) in Northern Ireland, on 42
poultry samples (56.5%), and that of Mammina et al.
(2003) in Italy, on laying hens and the environment of
chicken farms (20.3%). Whereas in a national study,



_Salmonella_ Heidelberg represents only 1.81% (Elgroud
et al., 2009). This serotype is among the 3 most common cases of human salmonellosis in Canada and one
of the 5 most prevalent in the USA, according to the
Canadian integrated program for monitoring of the
antimicrobial resistance (PICRA, 2006). According to
this program, international comparisons of human data
from 2000 to 2004 indicated that _Salmonella_ Heidelberg
was more common in North America, whereas Mammina et al. (2003) have shown that this serotype was
responsible for only a small proportion of human infection in Italy. According to Usera et al. (1999) and
the report of the European Community (EFSA, 2007),
_Salmonella_ Enteritidis was the most frequently reported, with prevalences of 46.1 and 42%, respectively, and
these are higher than those we have recorded. Our present result is higher than that recorded by Elgroud et
al. (2008; 3.63%). The isolation frequency of _Salmonella_
Infantis and _Salmonella_ Albany was comparable to that
given in Austria by Berghold and Kornschober (2002).
Similarly, the rate that we recorded for _Salmonella_
Typhimurium was comparable to that reported by Elgroud et al. (2009) and by Van Immerseel et al. (2005)
in poultry farms in Europe between 1991 and 2000 but
higher than that noted by these same authors in 2003.
The registered prevalence for _Salmonella_ Blockley was
lower than that found in Saudi Arabia (al-Nakhli et
al., 1999). _Salmonella_ Hadar, identified in 5% of our
strains, was the predominant serotype in Italy (Uyttendaele et al., 1998) and Senegal (Cardinale et al., 2005).
_Salmonella_ Pullorum, which has no impact on public
health, as related to host species has been eradicated
from poultry farms in several developed countries, such
as the USA and Canada. The declaration of pullorosis
in our farms could cause major economic losses, such as
those observed from the thirties to the sixties (Villate,
2001). In our study, _Salmonella_ Newport and _Salmonel-_
_la_ Montevideo were isolated with a very low prevalence.
These results are corroborated by the study of Elgroud
