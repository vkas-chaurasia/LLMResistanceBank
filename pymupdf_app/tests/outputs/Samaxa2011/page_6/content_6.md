of isolates) (12). This trend was also noted by Mrema et al.
(17), who found that 9.7% of sausage isolates were resistant
to tetracycline. However, 100% resistance was found for
sulfafurazole. Tetracycline and sulfafurazole were not
included in the panel of antibiotics in the present study, so
resistance to these two antibiotics could not be tracked.
However, all isolates were sensitive to tigecycline, a newgeneration derivative of tetracycline, and to the trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole combination. Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic similar to sulfafurazole, both of which
have a broader spectrum of activity than the generic
formulations. These data indicate a shift in resistant patterns;
Salmonella isolates found in the present study were
predominantly resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Nevertheless, all isolates from this study were susceptible to
carbapenems.

Because Salmonella Muenchen can cause transient
infections (3) and Salmonella Typhimurium is an established pathogen, the presence of multidrug resistance in
these pathogens presents a health care challenge. Salmonella
Enteritidis, which also was isolated, was resistant to a seven
antimicrobial drugs tested. Although antibiotics are not
routinely given to individuals with Salmonella infections,
antibiotics are prescribed to immunocompromised patients
and patients with systemic infections. The results of the
present study indicate that consumers of meat sausages are
at risk for being infected by multidrug-resistant Salmonella
strains. The information on the prevalence and the correlation between the serotype and antimicrobial resistance can
be useful for identifying trends and assessing the effectiveness of current initiatives within the food industry to
improve food hygiene strategies aimed at reducing bacterial
loads in primary production and at the various stages of the
food production chain.
