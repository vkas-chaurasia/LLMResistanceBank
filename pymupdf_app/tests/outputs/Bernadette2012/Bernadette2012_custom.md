Thermophilic _Campylobacters_ are major causes of gastroenteritis in human. The main risk factor of infection is consumption of
contaminated or by cross-contaminated poultry meat. In Cˆote d’Ivoire, gastroenteritis is usually observed but no case of human
campylobacteriosis has been formally reported to date. The aims of this study were to determine prevalence and antimicrobial
resistance of _Campylobacter jejuni_ and _Campylobacter coli_ isolated from chickens ceaca in commercial slaughter in Abidjan.
Between May and November 2009, one hundred and nineteen (119) chicken caeca samples were collected and analyzed by passive
filtration method followed by molecular identification (PCR). From these 119 samples, 76 (63.8%) were positive to _Campylobacter_
tests. Among the positive colonies, 51.3% were _C. jejuni_ and 48.7% were _C. coli_ . Of the 39 _C. jejuni_ isolates, 79.5%, 38.5%, 17.9%,
10.3%, and 7.7% were, respectively, resistant, to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin. Among
the 37 isolates of _C. coli_, 78.4%, 43.2%, 13.5%, 8.1%, and 0% were resistant, respectively, to the same antibiotics. In conclusion, we
reported in this study the presence of high _Campylobacter_ contamination of the studied chickens. Molecular identification of the
bacteria was performed and determination of high resistance to antimicrobials of the fluoroquinolone family was revealed.



**1. Introduction**


_Campylobacter bacteria_ are Gram negative, curved, highly
mobile, and microaerophilic. Thermophilic _Campylobacter_
species, particularly _Campylobacter jejuni_ and _Campylobacter_
_coli_, have been recognized as a major cause of acute
bacterial gastroenteritis in humans since 1970 and it is
estimated that _Campylobacter_ spp. are responsible for 400–
500 millions cases of diarrhea each year worldwide [1–4].
In developing countries, incidence of children under 5 years
old is estimated to 40 000 cases for 100 000 persons per year

[5, 6] and according to World Health Organization (WHO)
this incidence is underestimated.
Unpasteurized milk, water, and foods of animal origin are
potential sources of contaminations [7–9], but the major risk
factor for campylobacteriosis for humans is the consumption



of undercooked poultry and the handling of raw poultry [9–
16].
Most _Campylobacter_ infections do not need to be treated
with antimicrobial agents. However, in a subset of patients
_Campylobacter_ may cause severe complications and increased
risk for death and therefore requires treatment [17–19].
When clinical treatment is necessary, fluoroquinolones
(Ciprofloxacin, e.g.) or macrolides (Erythromycin) are currently used because of their large spectra activity on enteric
pathogens [20, 21].
However, antimicrobial drug resistance in _Campylobacter_
infections has increased dramatically in many countries
during the 1990s. This emergence of _strains_ resistance
to antimicrobials provoked controversy over the use of
antimicrobials in animal food production [22, 23].

Because of the increasing concerns of the public regarding the risk of exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria
through food, monitoring programs for antimicrobial resistances in indicator bacteria isolated from food animals have
been developed in a number of countries [24–27].
In Cˆote d’Ivoire, although poultry meat and particularly
broiler chicken is a major proteins source for the population,
no case of human campylobacteriosis has been published to
date. However, our study in 2005 [28] showed a high prevalence (67%) of _Campylobacter_ spp _._ in chickens. This situation
can be explained by the fact that _Vibrio cholerae_, _Salmonella,_
and many other microorganisms, out of _Campylobacter_,
are the priorities of health authorities of Cˆote d’Ivoire.
Therefore, survey data on the prevalence of _Campylobacter_
spp _._ mainly _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli_ (as they are responsible of
more than 98% cases of campylobacteriosis) [29] are needed.
In addition, determination of antimicrobial resistance of
_Campylobacter_ isolates from chickens is important.
The aims of this study were, on one hand, to estimate
prevalence of thermophilic C _ampylobacters_ in slaughtered
chickens in Abidjan by biochemical and molecular technical
and, on the other hand, to evaluate their antimicrobial
resistance.


**2. Material and Methods**


_2.1. Study Area and Sample Preparation._ This study was
conducted in Adjam´e, a municipality in the north part of
Abidjan. Adjam´e is the principal market of Abidjan with
more than 3 million visitors per day [30].
From May to November 2009, 119 samples of chicken
caeca were collected in a commercial poultry processing
plant. This plant is one of the primary poultry processing of
this municipality with visitors of diverse origin particularly
restaurateurs.
Each randomly selected sample was collected during
evisceration and put into a stomacher bag, then rapidly
transported to the laboratory in a cooler.


_2.2. Isolation and Biochemical Identification._ Isolation of
_Campylobacter_ was performed with passive filtration method
preceded by enrichment as proposed by Federighi [31].
Briefly, 1 g of caeca contents was transferred to 9 mL of
Preston enrichment broth base (CM 0067 Oxoid, OXOID
LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire,UK) containing _Campylobac-_
_ter_ growth factor (SR 0232E Oxoid, OXOID LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) and 7% (v/v) defibrinated sheep
blood. Incubation was performed in an anaerobic jar
containing a packet generator microaerophilic atmosphere
(5% oxygen, 10% carbon dioxide, 85% nitrogen) type
CAMPYGen (CN0025A Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire,
UK) during 24 hours at 37 _[◦]_ C. After enrichment, 300 _µ_ L of
broth was filtered through acetate cellulose filter (0.45 _µ_ m)
on Columbia agar (Sharlau; Barcelona, Spain) containing
5% (v/v) fresh sheep blood at aerobic conditions during one
hour.
The filter was removed from agar and _Campylobacter_
was isolated at 42 _[◦]_ C during 48 hours under microaerophilic
atmosphere.



One presumptive _Campylobacter_ colony from each agar
plate was subcultured and identified by Gram staining
reaction, and biochemical pattern for oxidase, catalase,
indoxyl acetate hydrolysis, and hippurate hydrolysis [32]. All
isolates were stored in 25% (v/v) glycerol-peptone broth at

_−_ 70 _[◦]_ C.


_2.3. DNA Extraction and PCR Conditions._ Genomic DNAs
from all isolated colonies were obtained by treatment
with dodecyl sulfate sodium and proteinase K followed by
extraction with phenol-chloroform and precipitation with
ethanol [33]. PCR procedures used in this study have been
described previously by Linton et al. [34]. Two genes for the
identification of _Campylobacter jejuni_ and _Campylobacter coli_
were used: _hipo_ gene (encoding _C. jejuni_ hippurase) and _asp_
gene (encoding _C. coli_ aspartokinase). Sequences of the two
sets of primers used for gene amplification are _asp_ (F 5 _[′]_ GGT ATG ATT TCT ACA AAG CGA G-3 _[′]_ and R 5 _[′]_ -ATA
TAT CGT CGC GTG AAAGAC-3 _[′]_ ) and _hipo_ (F 5 _[′]_ -GAA GAG
GGT TTG GGT GGT G-3 _[′]_ and R 5 _[′]_ -AGC CGC ATA ATA
ACT TAGCTTTG-3 _[′]_ ).
PCR was performed in final volume of 50 _µ_ L mix
containing 2.5 _µ_ L of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate
(10 mM), 2.5 _µ_ L of MgCl2 (25 mM), 10 _µ_ L of Buffer 5X DNA
Taq polymerase, 0.4 _µ_ L of Taq polymerase, 1.5 _µ_ L of each
primer _asp_ (10 _µ_ M), and 5 _µ_ L of each primer _hipo_ (10 _µ_ M).
Amplification reactions were carried out using thermal cycler
(Gene Amp PCR system type 9700, Applied Biosystems,
Villebon-sur-yvette, France) with the following program:
an initial denaturation at 94 _[◦]_ C for 15 min followed by 30
cycles of denaturation at 94 _[◦]_ C for 1 min, annealing at 49 _[◦]_ C
for 1 min and polymerization at 72 _[◦]_ C for 1 min. A final
extension was performed at 72 _[◦]_ C for 7 min.
The amplification generated 735 bp and 500 bp DNA
fragments corresponding, respectively, to _Campylobacter_
_jejuni_ and _Campylobacter coli_ . The PCR products were
stained with a 0.6% solution of ethidium bromide and were
visualized under UV light after gel electrophoresis on 1.5%
agarose.


_2.4. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing._ Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion method
using Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) supplemented with 5%
defibrinated sheep blood, according to Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [35]. Disks impregnated with antibiotics (Biomerieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France)
and their corresponding concentration are the followings:
ciprofloxacin (CIP: 5 _µ_ g); nalidixic acid (NA: 30 _µ_ g); erythromycin (E: 15 _µ_ g); gentamicin (GM: 10 UI); amoxicillin
(AMX: 25 _µ_ g).
Briefly, well-isolated colonies of same morphological
type were selected from an agar plate culture and transferred
into 10 mL of sterile saline buffer (NaCl 0.9%). After
homogenization, 2 mL of the mixture were flooded onto
the surface of a Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) containing
5% defibrinated sheep blood. The inoculum was allowed to
dry for 5 min and antibiotic discs were placed on the plate.
After 48 h of microaerobic incubation at 37 _[◦]_ C, diameters of

were used as reference strains. The isolates were classified
as sensitive, intermediate, and resistant according to the
guidelines prepared by CLSI [35].


**3. Results**


_3.1. Prevalence._ Overall, 119 chickens ceaca were purchased from one commercial slaughter and cultured for
thermophilic _Campylobacters._ From these 119 samples, 76
(63,8%) were positives and 43 (36.2%) were negatives to
_Campylobacter_ tests. Among the _Campylobacter_ positives,
51.3% were _Campylobacter jejuni_ and 48.7% were _Campy-_
_lobacter coli_ .


_3.2. Antimicrobial Susceptibility._ The results of antimicrobial
susceptibility testing for _Campylobacter_ spp. isolated from
chickens to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin are presented in Table 1.
For all isolates, antimicrobial resistance to nalidixic
acid and ciprofloxacin was observed in 78.9% and 50%,
respectively.
Among the 39 isolates of _C. jejuni_ 79.5% ; 38.5% ;
17.9%; 7.7% were resistant to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin,
amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin, respectively.
Among the 37 isolates, 78.4%; 43.2%; 13.5%; 8.1% were
resistant to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and
erythromycin, respectively. In this study all isolates of _C. coli_
were sensitive to gentamicin.


**4. Discussion**


Case-control studies of foodborne infection rates have
estimated that 50 to 70% of _Campylobacter_ illness is due to
consumption of contaminated poultry and their products

[9, 17, 36]. Several studies examined thermophilic _Campy-_
_lobacter_ in poultry, and the findings indicated prevalence



ranges of the bacteria from 3% to 98% with _C. jejuni_ or _C._
_coli_ as the main isolates [36, 37].
Poultry and their products are commonly consumed
in modern Ivoirians diets, but campylobacteriosis is not
reported in Cˆote d’Ivoire up to now. Therefore, the primarily
objective of this study was to determine prevalence of
thermophilic species including _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli,_ in
poultry in Abidjan.
This work demonstrated high prevalence of thermophilic
_Campylobacter_ in the studied chickens (63.8%). This proportion is similar to the results obtained in previous study
(66.6%) [28]. Among the _Campylobacter_ isolates 51.3% were
_C. jejuni_ and 48.7% were _C. coli_ .
Such a high isolation rate of thermophilic _Campylobacter_
in chickens has also been reported [37–42]. However,
prevalence of _C. coli_ in chicken is higher in this study than
others findings [39, 42].
Poor hygiene and sanitation in poultry farms in Cˆote
d’Ivoire could explain this high level of prevalence of _C. coli_ .
Indeed, most farms do not have security fence to prevent
penetration of other animals including pigs, which are good
carriers of _C. coli_ . In some cases flocks of sheep or cattle and
poultry take place at the same sites contributing like that to
the contamination of chicken flocks with _C. coli_ .
Antibiogram test indicated higher resistance of the
microorganisms to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid. Recent
studies reported that fluoroquinolone-resistant _Campylobac-_
_ter_ spp. rapidly emerged among poultry flocks [19, 24, 43,
44].
Alfredson and Korolik [45] advanced an hypothesis
to explain this observation. They suggested that the use
of enrofloxacin (derivates close to the fluoroquinolones
used in human medicine) in animals flocks has probably
exerted a selection pressure in animal reservoirs [22]. The
absence of fluoroquinolone resistance of _Campylobacter_ in
Australia, country that has never used enrofloxacin, is a
strong argument in favor of this hypothesis.

Resistance to erythromycin and amoxicillin, two antibiotics widely used to treat illness in Cˆote d’Ivoire, is not negligible. However, rates of that resistance are lower compared
to those obtained with the fluoroquinolones.
These results are similar to previous observations [19,
20, 45–48]. The relatively high percentages of resistance to
most antimicrobial agents tested in our study may be due to
high usage of these agents as growth promoters or in animal
treatment. In fact, in Cote d’Ivoire, as in most of developing
countries [49], the use of antibiotics for humans and animals
is relatively unrestricted.
Furthermore, no measures of hygiene are observed in
both farms and in the process of slaughter which could cause
contamination of poultry carcasses. Since campylobacteriosis is transmitted by consumption of contaminated food,
preferably poultry, the presence of strains of antibioticresistant _Campylobacter_ on chicken meat can be a real
public health problem in Cˆote d’Ivoire. Indeed, the situation
could deteriorate more rapidly in the study area, where
there is an expansion of poultry farms with widespread
and uncontrolled use of antibiotics. Therefore, surveillance
of resistance pattern is necessary to guide rational use of
antimicrobial agents in poultry farms.
In conclusion, we reported the presence of high contamination in poultry in Cˆote d’Ivoire by thermophilic
_Campylobacter_ and high resistance to antimicrobials of the
fluoroquinolone family. These results show the need to
strengthen the implementation of specific control procedures
to decrease the contamination of poultry meat by _Campy-_
_lobacter_ and the necessity to reduce using of antibiotics in
poultry sector. This study also shows the need to establish an
efficient system for the control of _Campylobacter_ in chickens.
