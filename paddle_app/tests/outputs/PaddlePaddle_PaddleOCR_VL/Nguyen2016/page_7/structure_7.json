All isolates of this study which were resistant to ciprofloxacin carried a mutation of the amino acid 86 of the gyrA resulting in a change from threonine to isoleucine. This mutation was detected also in 3 DNA samples extracted from skimmed milk. The MAMA–PCR protocol allowed the detection of the gyrA mutation and PCR–RFLP was confirming the mutation from (ACA to ATA) of amino acid 86. This result was in agreement with previous reports showing that both methods are simple, reliable, rapid tools that can be used as screening methods  $ [27, 37] $ . In Campylobacter, resistance to erythromycin is chemosomally encoded by an alteration of the 23S rRNA gene. High level resistance to erythromycin is caused by mutations at position 2074 and/or 2075 of the domain V of this gene. In this study the mutations were neither detected by MAMA–PCR nor by PCR–RFLP.",

In this study, only 54.5 % of the tetracycline resistant isolates harboured the tet(O) gene. The tet(A) gene also plays a role in resistance to tetracycline  $ [22] $ . The efflux gene tet(A) is coding for an approximately 46 kDa membrane-bound efflux protein for membrane-associated proteins and is involved in the export of tetracycline from the cell  $ [50] $ . In this study, using the recommended primers for tet(A) amplification  $ [18] $  PCR products of 696 bp instead of 888 bp were obtained. DNA sequencing of amplicons and database search resulted in 99.0 % homology to a partial putative integral membrane protein and a putative periplasmic protein. Hence, a new PCR assay based on tet(A) gene sequences for C. jejuni (acc. no. JX891464) and C. coli (acc. no. JX891463) was developed. Parameters such as limit of detection, limit of quantification, PCR efficiency and specificity were considered during an in-house validation process. Amplicon length was 486 and the amplicons were sequenced to confirm the identity. The tet(A) gene was much more frequently identified in the Kenyan Campylobacter isolates than tet(O) (35 vs 13).",

High level of resistance to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and nalidixic acid as well as multidrug resistance was detected previously in Kenya. In Kenya, this problem is reported to be caused by the increasing rate of unregulated over-the-counter sale without prescriptions of these antibiotics, mainly to humans self-treatment of suspected infections and to a lesser extent for use in animals  $ [51] $ . These findings also demonstrate the potential for antibiotic-resistant bacteria to spread through the food chain from animals treated with antibiotics for humans. Such misuse and overuse may have resulted in the selection of resistant mutants or acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes from other organisms through the process of genetic exchange.",
