**Statistical analysis.** The relation of the presence of transferable elements encoding antimicrobial resistance in coliphages isolated from
chicken meat samples to the recovery of phenotypically antimicrobialresistant _E. coli_ isolates from the same samples was studied for four different antimicrobial substances. For this purpose, information on resistance
transfer from all phages (typically, five) per sample was combined; i.e., a
sample was considered to carry transferable resistance against an antimicrobial substance if at least one of the phages isolated from this sample was
able to transfer the respective resistance. The relation of the presence/
absence of resistant _E. coli_ to the presence/absence of phages able to transduce the respective antimicrobial resistance was then assessed by Fisher’s
exact test. The significance level was established at a _P_ value of �0.05.

**RESULTS**
**Detection of antimicrobial-resistant** _**E. coli**_ **isolates in chicken**
**meat.** One or more resistant _E. coli_ isolates whose resistance was
determined using antimicrobial susceptibility testing by broth
microdilution could be isolated from 47 out of 50 chicken meat
samples using selective plating. Most _E. coli_ isolates were resistant to ampicillin (44 of 50 samples), followed by tetracycline
(40 of 50 samples). Kanamycin-resistant isolates were found in
22 chicken meat samples, and chloramphenicol-resistant isolates were found in 18. Table 2 shows the numbers of samples
with the different types of resistant _E. coli_ isolates. Ampicillinresistant as well as tetracycline-resistant _E. coli_ strains were found
the most often in the chicken meat samples ( _n_ - 12, 24%); this
was followed by _E. coli_ isolates resistant to all different antimicrobials tested and _E. coli_ isolates resistant to ampicillin, kanamycin,
and tetracycline ( _n_ - 10 [20%] for each group). Six samples harbored ampicillin-resistant _E. coli_ isolates only. Five samples carried _E. coli_ isolates with resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
as well as tetracycline. Three samples did not harbor any _E. coli_
isolates resistant to the tested antimicrobial substances. One sample each held _E. coli_ strains resistant to tetracycline only; chloramphenicol and tetracycline; chloramphenicol, kanamycin,
and tetracycline; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin.
**Resistance-transducing phage isolated from chicken meat.**
Coliphages were detected in all but one chicken meat sample.
The sample with no coliphage did not hold any resistant _E. coli_
isolates. About 90% of the phages isolated revealed a clear plaque
morphology, and 10% produced a cloudy center. Of all phages
randomly isolated from chicken meat ( _n_ - 243), about a quarter
( _n_ - 60) were able to transduce one or more of the tested antimicrobial resistances into _E. coli_ ATCC 13706. Phages able to transduce antimicrobial resistance were isolated from 22 out of a total
of 50 chicken meat samples. Phages which transduced kanamycin
