The incidence of CNS may render food unsafe, as the clinical isolates have been reported to exude virulent traits (Fowoyo and Ogunbanwo, 2016). Our findings emphasize the need for improved hygiene practices during food processing and also during the distribution and consumption of the final food products to avoid the presence of CNS and CPS isolates in meat. The present study cynosures that the MRS has entered the food chain in Egypt through the raw chicken meat constituting a health hazard to consumers and should be given importance due to their zoonotic importance. This necessitates the urgent implementation of an energetic policy to ensure microbiological food safety to prevent the spread of MRS through the food chain by contamination of raw meat. In addition, these isolates might indicate the promulgation of methicillin, oxacillin, and vancomycin resistance in the community and imply food safety hazards.",
