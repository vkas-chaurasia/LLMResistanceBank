Thus, detection of Salmonella contamination in food is an essential quality control practice of food manufacturers and processors. Rapid identification methods for the detection of foodborne bacterial pathogens have become an important aspect of the food industry. However, these new methods must be rigorously examined for their applicability in diverse and unique food matrices before they can be routinely accepted. In line with global trends, modern animal husbandry in Botswana has increased the use of antimicrobials for both disease therapy and as prophylactics to prevent the onset of infectious diseases and enhance growth. This increased use has resulted in a rise in the number of antimicrobial resistant pathogens (1), which poses a major public health problem because these resistant strains can spread from their animal reservoirs to humans, hence decreasing the number of antimicrobials that are effective for treating human infections.",
