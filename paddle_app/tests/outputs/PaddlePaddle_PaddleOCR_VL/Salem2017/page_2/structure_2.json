            "block_content": "Multiple factors determine the virulence of S. enterica, which are primarily encoded by chromosomal genes, unlinked or clustered in islets (composed by a few genes) and larger pathogenicity islands (SPIs). In Salmonella more than 20 SPIs have been detected so far, with SPI1 to SPI5 being linked to well-defined pathogenic processes  $ [9] $ . SPI-1 and SPI-2 encode different type III secretion systems which deliver effector proteins into the cytosol of the host cell, leading to bacterial invasion of the intestinal epithelium as well as proliferation of Salmonella within eukaryotic cells. SPI-3 encodes a magnesium transporter involved in adaptation of Salmonella to the adverse intracellular environment. SPI-4 encodes a giant non-fimbrial adhesin (SiiE) and a type I secretion system responsible for its transport. SiiE mediates close interaction with microvilli at the apical side of epithelial cells. SPI-5 is connected with inflammation and chloride secretion during the enteric phase of the disease  $ [9,10] $ . Other non SPI-associated genes also play an important role during infection, for example, prophage-encoded genes and fimbrial gene clusters  $ [11,12] $ . In addition, some serotypes of S. enterica, including S. Enteritidis, harbor virulence-plasmids of variable size, which share the spv (Salmonella plasmid virulence) locus. The spv region seems to promote rapid growth and survival of S. enterica within the host cells and is thus believed to play an important role in systemic infections  $ [13] $ .",

Enteritidis as the most common serotype recovered from human specimens (24.1%; 1640/6815) and animals (69%; 1551/2249), and the second serotype found in food products (15.8%; 877/5539), only preceded by S. Anatum. In addition, S. Enteritidis was the most common serotype in poultry (70.3%; 1378/1959) and poultry meat (27.7%; 415/1496) [4]. A more recent study also supported the predominance of S. Enteritidis in chicken products along the 2008–2011 years [6]. Despite this, information available on the resistance and genetic properties of isolates from chickens and environmental farm samples in Tunisia is rather limited. The aim of the present study was the characterization of a collection of S. Enteritidis isolates obtained from these sources with respect to their resistance properties, virulence gene content, plasmid patterns and XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles.",

Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the S. Eppendorf isolates have previously been reported [14]. In the present study we focused on S. Enteritidis isolates owing to their high incidence. Only 77 out of the 85 originally detected isolates could be recovered for further analysis. They were obtained from samples (feces, organs and/or embryonic eggs) of healthy (38) and sick chickens (8; suffering from colibacillosis or pasteurellosis), and of the farm environment (31; waste of hatching, feathers, dust and water). The isolates were collected in 17 farms (located in central and north eastern regions of the country) or during official controls along the period of four years. Initial detection was done according to ISO method 6579/2002 and the isolates were confirmed as Salmonella by API 20E (Bio-Mérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Serotype was determined by slide agglutination with the use of antisera (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) to identify somatic O antigens and flagellar H antigens, according to the Kauffmann–White–Le Minor scheme [15].",
