Figure 1 Distribution of E. coli count among the 5 retail outlet
classifications. Counts were evenly distributed., the size of the
boxes for high- middle income, low-middle income and low income
areas indicate that the middle 50% E. coli counts are spread out for
these groups while for high class butcheries and supermarkets the
box sizes indicate that the middle 50% of the counts are
clumped together.


multiplication. Studies in Iran and Switzerland showed that
there were significant differences in contamination rates
between individually packed and unpacked chicken meat
samples [38,39]. Use of freezers and cooling temperatures
for storage and display in some outlets from high middle
income and low income areas could have resulted to few
samples falling under the acceptable food safety range in
these outlets as seen from the outliers in Figure 1 [40,41].
In most retail outlets, the degree of physical contact
between different kinds of meat on display such as beef,
fish and mutton may have led to cross contamination of
different meats. Also, use of bare hands in handling meat,
utensils and money at the same time as observed may
have increased chances of microbial contamination [42].
In contrast to the findings in this study, a similar recent

study in Accra, Ghana found that even though hygienic
conditions in supermarkets were generally better than
those in local markets and farms, there was no significant
difference between the microbial counts for these retail
outlets and they all had low microbial counts [43]. The authors attributed this observation to the deliberate efforts
by the food sector in improving the hygienic procedures
in the processing of poultry over the years.

Similar prevalence of antibiotic resistance in E. coli
isolated from retail chicken have been observed in other
studies ranging from 40.6% in Japan, 52% in Iceland,
84.6% in Minneapolis, U.S.A, 83.8% in Vietnam and even
100% isolates in Senegal being resistant to one or more
antibiotics [31,44-47]. The high prevalence of resistance
in poultry meat isolates is alarming given the evidence of
possible transmission of antibiotic resistant food borne
bacteria to consumers and food handlers [48]. Similar
multi-drug resistance phenotypes of E. coli isolated from
retail chicken have been reported in studies conducted
in Japan, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Slovakia [30,31,49,50].
The common resistance phenotypes observed are of
great clinical significance since these antimicrobials
are considered to be among the frontline therapeutic
drugs for treatment of most bacterial infections in
