allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature. From
each sample, 1 ml was added to 9 ml of buffered peptone
water (Oxoid) for _E. coli_ cultivation and 9 ml of Rappaport–Vassiliadis broth (Oxoid) for _S. enterica_ isolation.
After aerobic incubation at 37 °C overnight, a loopful from Rappaport–Vassiliadis broth was streaked on
xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) agar (Oxoid) and from
buffered peptone water on eosin methylene blue (EMB)
agar (Oxoid). The inoculated plates were incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Suspected colonies were
identified biochemically using API 20E (bioMérieux,
Marcy-l’Étoile, France).
All biochemically confirmed _Salmonella_ isolates were
serotyped on the basis of somatic (O) and flagellar (H)
antigens by slide agglutination test using commercial
antisera (SIFIN, Berlin, Germany) following Kauffman–
White scheme [19]. Serological identification of _E. coli_
was carried out using slide agglutination method using
commercial antisera (SIFIN). The serotyping was carried out at the Serology Unit, Animal Health Research
Institute, Dokki, Egypt, and the Bacteriology Laboratory, Central Laboratories of Ministry of Health, Cairo,
Egypt.


**DNA extraction and purification**
The identified bacterial cultures were cultivated in Luria–
Bertani (LB) broth (Oxoid) at 37 °C overnight. DNA was
extracted and purified using DNeasy Blood and Tissue
Kits (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.


**Molecular identification of** _**S. enterica**_ **serovars and** _**E. coli**_
The isolated strains were further identified as _S. enterica_
and _E. coli_ using PCR assays. The amplification targets
and primers (Eurofins, Yokohama, Japan) are listed in



Table 3. All phenotypically identified _S. enterica_ serovars were tested for harbouring _omp_ C gene. Isolated _E._
_coli_ were confirmed by species-specific PCR targeting the
16S _r_ RNA genes and resulting in a 585 bp amplicon. PCR
assays used in this study resulted in _Salmonella_, _S_ . Enteritidis and _S_ . Typhimurium specific products of 204, 304
and 401 bp length, respectively.
The PCR protocol consisted of the following steps: (i)
an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 95 °C; (ii) 30 cycles
with 1 cycle consisting of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 57 °C,
and 2 min at 72 °C; and (iii) a final elongation step of
5 min at 72 °C.
Five-microliter aliquots of reaction mixture were run in
electrophoreses using 1.5% agarose gels (Nippon Gene,
Tokyo, Japan) and visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining.


**Determination of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles**
The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using
the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion test [20]. Briefly, one colony picked up, streaked on Mueller–Hinton blood agar
(Oxoid) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Bacterial colonies were suspended in 0.9% NaCl to obtain a McFarland turbidity of 0.5 (Dr. Lange, photometer CADAS 30,
Berlin, Germany) containing 1–2 × 10 [8] colony-forming
units (CFU)/ml of _E. coli_ strain ATCC 25922. Three hundred μl of the suspension were spread onto the surface of
a Mueller–Hinton agar plate (Oxoid) using a sterile swab.
The antimicrobial discs (Oxoid) of thirteen clinically used
antibiotics, which are used in the Egyptian poultry and
cattle farms (Tables 4, 5) were distributed onto the surface of the Mueller–Hinton agar plates using a multi-disc
dispenser (Oxoid). The plates were incubated at 37 °C
overnight. The diameters of inhibition zones were measured using sliding calipers and interpreted using standard
