**Abstract**
Background: This study determines the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of _Salmonella_ serovars from humans and chickens in Ibadan,
Nigeria, in 2004-2007.
Methodology: A total of 991 blood samples were collected from patients in 2004 to 2005 and 641 fecal samples were collected from poultry
farms in 2007. All _Salmonella_ isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility.
Results: Thirty-nine (4%) _Salmonella_ isolates were obtained from human blood and 70 (11%) from chicken fecal samples. The human
isolates revealed nine different serovars; 82% were non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ and 18% were ( _S_ . Typhi). The majority of serovars from
humans were _S_ . Enteritidis (33%), _S_ . Dublin (18%), and _S_ . Typhimurium (18%). Resistance to chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole,
trimethoprim, and ampicillin ranged from 36% to 59% for the human isolates.
Eight different serovars were obtained from chickens; _S_ . Virchow (71%) predominated. A high frequency (87%) of reduced susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin was observed among the chicken isolates. A high frequency of resistance to tetracycline (93%), nalidixic acid (81%), and
sulfamethoxazole (87%) was observed. Rare serovars such as _S_ . Apapa, _S_ . Mouschaui, _S._ Jukestown, _S_ . Oritamerin, and _S_ . Onireke were
isolated from both humans and chickens. Identical serovars were not found among human and chicken isolates.
Conclusions: This study indicates that chickens are not a reservoir of _Salmonella_ causing bacteraemia among humans in Ibadan, Nigeria.
Studies locating the reservoirs responsible for invasive salmonellosis in humans are needed. Controls and targeted interventions against _S_ .
Virchow and the frequent occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in chickens should be initiated to prevent the spread of this serovar.

**Introduction** severe [7]. The ability of _Salmonella_ to cause



_Salmonella enterica_ is an important food-borne
pathogen that is currently divided into 2,587
serotypes [1]. The typhiodal _Salmonella_ serovars are
host-restricted human pathogens and include
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi and _S_ . Paratyphi

[2]. Non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ (NTS) are zoonotic
agents and a wide variety of animals have been
identified as reservoirs [3-5]. Poultry are considered
as one of the most common vehicles of human
salmonellosis [6].

Salmonellosis is often associated with
gastroenteritis, which is usually self-limiting. In some
cases, particularly in children, the elderly, and
immunocompromised patients, _Salmonella_ infection
can lead to invasive and focal infections that can be



severe [7]. The ability of _Salmonella_ to cause
invasive infection varies with the serovar, the age of
patient, and region. _S_ . Typhi and _S_ . Paratyphi A are
highly invasive for both children and adults. Certain
serovars of NTS, such as _S_ . Choleraesuis, _S_ . Dublin,
and _S_ . Virchow, have higher abilities than other
serovars to cause invasive salmonellosis [8-10]. In
sub-Saharan Africa, NTS invasive infections are a
public health concern for infants, young children, and
young adults suffering from malnutrition, malaria,
and HIV infection [11-13]. Most human infections
are caused by a limited number of serovars, which
may vary from country to country and over time. The
predominant serovars in some African countries
include _S._ Enteritidis, _S_ . Typhimurium, _S._ Concord,
and _S_ . Isangi [10,12-16].

In Nigeria, there is limited data of the prevalence
in _Salmonella_ serovars causing human salmonellosis
and the importance of transmitting food-borne
pathogens from the food chain to humans is not well
understood. Decades ago, a study reported the
important role of _S_ . Typhi and NTS in septicemia in
humans in Ibadan, Nigeria; however, the specific
NTS serotypes [17] were not revealed, probably due
to the lack of resources and high-quality antisera that
are often lacking from many African countries [18].
Chicken is an important food source to man; chicken
meat dishes are special delicacies, particularly during
festive periods in Nigeria, but the poultry industry is
largely unregulated. The link between human
salmonellosis and consumption of chicken is not
known nor is the prevalence of the serovars in
Nigeria. A previous study found the prevalence of _S_ .
Enteritidis in chicken meat in Maiduguri, Nigeria, to
be 27% [19]. A recent study from Maiduguri, in the
northern part of Nigeria, reported _S_ . Hiduddify to be
the predominant serovar in free-range chickens and
poultry meat [20].

Treatment with antimicrobials is crucial for the
proper management of severe or invasive human
salmonellosis. Fluoroquinolones and third-generation
cephalosporins are now commonly used in adults for
treatment due to widespread resistance to
chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and cotrimoxazole [21].
Fluoroquinolones are often the last resort for
treatment of children and are listed by the World
Health Organization as critically important
antimicrobials for human health [7,22]. Multi-drug
resistance and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin
have been reported from some African countries.
Increasing multi-drug resistance associated with NTS
in humans has been reported from Malawi and
Ethiopia [15,23]; multi-drug resistance rates of 10%
or less with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin
have also been reported from Senegal [14]. A recent
study reported high rates of resistance to
ciprofloxacin in _S_ . Hiduddify in chickens in
Maiduguri, Nigeria [20]; otherwise, there are limited
data on antimicrobial resistance on _Salmonella_ in
both humans and food animals in Nigeria.

This study was conducted to determine the
prevalence of _Salmonella_ serovars in chickens and
from invasive extraintestinal salmonellosis in humans
from the city of Ibadan, Nigeria, in various periods
between 2004 and 2007. The susceptibility to
antimicrobial resistance in the _Salmonella_ isolates
was also investigated and the presence of _qnr_ genes
was investigated in the isolates with a resistance



phenotype indicating the presence of _qnr_ genes. The
serovars and susceptibility patterns of the isolates
from the different reservoirs were compared.


**Materials and methods**
_Isolation of bacteria from humans_

During 2004 and 2005, blood samples were
collected from 991 febrile patients attending seven
major hospitals and a private diagnostic laboratory in
Ibadan province. Blood samples of 10 to 15 mL and 2
to 5 mL of were collected from adults and children,
respectively. Bacteria were isolated from each blood
sample following standard procedure by using BrainHeart infusion broth (Lab M, Lancashire, UK)
followed by plating on Brain-Heart Infusion agar
supplemented with 5% sheep blood, _Salmonella-_
_Shigella_ agar (Lab M, Lancashire, UK), and
McConkey agar (Lab M, Lancashire, UK). The
isolates were incubated aerobically at 37 [°] C for 18 to
24 hours [24]. Presumptive _Salmonella_ colonies were
identified by standard methods [25,26].


_Isolation of bacteria from chicken_

In 2007, a total of 641 fecal samples were
collected at 12 intensive poultry farms. Five grams of
each chicken fecal sample were enriched in 25 mL of
selenite-F broth (Lab M, Lancashire, UK) and
incubated aerobically at 37 [°] C for 18 to 24 hours
followed by plating on _Salmonella_ - _Shigella_ agar (Lab
M, Lancashire, UK) and incubated aerobically at
37 [°] C for 18 to 24 hours. Presumptive _Salmonella_
colonies were identified following standard methods

[25,26].


_Statistical analysis_

SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc.) was used
to assess the association of the prevalence in males
compared to the prevalence in females using a
Fisher’s Exact test. The criteria for evaluating the
significance level in the model was a P-value of <
0.05.


_Serotyping_

Serotyping of all the presumptive biochemical
positive _Salmonella_ isolates was performed at the
National _Salmonella_ and _Shigella_ Centre, Bangkok,
Thailand, according to the previously described
method [27].


_Antimicrobial susceptibility testing_

Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was
performed at the National Food Institute,

Copenhagen, Denmark (DTU-FOOD) on all
_Salmonella_ isolates as minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) determinations according to the
previously described method [27]. In addition to the
previously described method, the following
antimicrobial and resistance epidemiological cut-off
values were used in the study for cefotaxime; (R > 2
mg/mL) (www.eucast.org).


_Detection of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance_
_genes_

Strains showing reduced susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin and susceptible to nalidixic acid were
further characterized through the use of a PCR assay
with primers specific for _qnr_ A, _qnr_ B, _qnr_ C, _qnr_ D,
_qnr_ S, and _aac(6’)-lb_ [23,28,29]. PCR products were
purified using the GFX™ PCR DNA kit (GE
Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) and submitted to
Macrogen Inc. for sequencing. Sequence analysis and
alignment was performed using the Vecton NTI suite
9 (InforMax Inc., Bethesda, Maryland, US) and the
resulting nucleotide sequences were compared to
sequences obtained from GenBank
(http://www.lahey.org/studies/webt.html).


**Results**
_Bacterial isolates from humans_

Of the 991 blood samples collected, 519 samples
originated from males. Thirty-nine samples yielded
_Salmonella_, which gave an overall prevalence among
humans submitting a blood sample at 4%. The
prevalence ranged substantially between the different
sample sites from 1% (diagnostic laboratory) to 10%
(hospital B) (Table 1). The prevalence between males
and females differed with 5% among males in
contrast to 3% among females (not significant p =



0.07). The overall age of patients from whom the
positive blood samples were collected ranged from
seven days to 28 years; however, large differences
were observed between the different hospitals: 7 days
to 4 years in hospital A; 3 months to 2 years and 6
months in hospital B; 18 days to 2 years in hospital
C; 2 years and 5 months to 7 years in hospital D; 1
year and 7 months to 10 years and 7 months in
hospital E; 1 year and 3 months to 16 years in
hospital F; 11 years to 28 years in hospital G; and 14
years at the diagnostic laboratory. The median age of
the febrile patients that yielded _Salmonella_ was 1
year and 7 months.


_Bacterial isolates from chickens_

Out of the 641 chicken fecal samples collected,
70 were positive for _Salmonella_, giving an overall
prevalence of 11%. The number of samples
investigated and the number of samples positive for
_Salmonella_ fluctuated among the different farms,
resulting in a prevalence ranging from 2% (farm C
and G) to 26% (farm J) (Table 2).


_Serotyping of human isolates_

The 39 human isolates revealed nine different
_Salmonella_ serovars of which 32 (82%) were NTS
and seven (18%) were _S._ Typhi. The most commonly
isolated serovars were _S_ . Enteritidis (n = 13; 33%), _S_ .
Dublin (n = 7; 18%), _S_ . Typhimurium (n = 7; 18), and
_S_ . Typhi (n = 7; 18%). Several uncommon serovars
were among the isolated _Salmonella_, such as _S_ .
Jukestown (n = 1; 3%), _S_ . Monschaui (n = 1; 3%), _S._
Oritamerin (n = 1; 3%), and _S._ Apapa (n = 1; 3%),
which were all from different sample sites (Table 3).

Hospitals A and B accounted for 21 of the
isolates. These two hospitals also accounted for four
out of seven (57%) _S_ . Dublin, 10 out of 13 (77%) _S_ .
Enteritidis, and six out of seven (86%) _S_ .
Typhimurium (Table 3). None of the serovars found
in humans were observed among the isolates from
chicken (Tables 3 and 4).


_Serotyping of chicken isolates_

The 70 _Salmonella_ isolates revealed eight
different serovars with _S_ . Virchow being the most
frequent, accounting for 71% (n = 50) of all serovars
isolated from chickens. _S_ . Virchow was found in
chickens from 11 of the 12 farms, accounting for
92% (n = 22) and 83% (n = 10) of all serovars found
on farms J and K. Additionally, it was the only
serovar originating from chickens in farms B, C, and
D (Table 2). Two uncommon serovars from chickens
were isolated: _S_ . Haifa (n = 2; 3%) and _S_ . Onireke (n
= 1; 1%) (Table 2).


_Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of human isolates_

The _Salmonella_ isolates originating from humans
were all susceptible to apramycin, ceftiofur, colistin,
florfenicol, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and neomycin.
Low frequency of resistance was observed to
nalidixic acid (3%) and ciprofloxacin (3%).



Antimicrobial resistance to spectinomycin,
chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin
ranged from 18% to 44%. A higher frequency of
antimicrobial resistance was observed to
sulfamethoxazole (54%), trimethoprim (54%),
amoxicillin+clavulanic (54%), and ampicillin (59%)
(Table 4). Three of the seven _S._ Dublin were resistant
to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline, and trimethoprim; the remaining four
isolates were pansusceptible. Antimicrobial
resistance was observed in eleven of the 13 _S._
Enteritidis isolates. Four _S_ . Enteritidis isolates
conferred resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. Two additional
isolates also conferred resistance to streptomycin.
One of the remaining five _S_ . Enteritidis isolates was
resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim, streptomycin,
amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, nalidixic acid, and
tetracycline. None of the 13 _S_ . Enteritidis isolates
were pansusceptible (data not shown). Six of seven _S._
Typhi isolates were pansusceptible while the
remaining one isolate was resistant only to
streptomycin.

florfenicol, and cefotaxime. In contrast, we observed
a high level of antimicrobial resistance to tetracycline
(n = 65; 93%), ciprofloxacin (n = 61, 87%), nalidixic
acid (n = 57; 81%), sulfamethoxazole (n = 61; 87%),
and trimethoprim (n = 53; 76%), respectively (Table
5). None of the chicken isolates showed high levels
of resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC ≥ 2 µg/mL);
however, 87% (n = 61) of the isolates exhibited
reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. The reduced
susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was observed in all of
the following serovars: _S_ . Virchow (n = 50; 100%), _S_ .
Derby (n = 4; 100%), _S_ . Haifa (n = 2; 100%), _S_ .
Bredeney (n = 1; 100%), _S_ . Onireke (n = 1; 100%), _S_ .
Mbandaka (n = 2; 33%), and _S_ . Muenster (n = 1;
20%), respectively (Table 5). The four isolates of _S._
Derby were all susceptible to nalidixic acid but
exhibited reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin,
indicating a plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
phenotype. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the three
most commonly isolated serovars revealed that _S._
Virchow (n = 50), _S._ Mbandaka (n = 6), and _S._
Muenster (n = 5) were also the serovars with the most
resistant susceptibility patterns. Those serovars
showed resistance to ten ( _S._ Virchow), nine ( _S._
Muenster), and eight ( _S._ Mbandaka) of the seventeen
tested antimicrobials, respectively (Table 5). Six
resistance patterns were observed among _S_ . Virchow;
most (n = 31; 62%,) were resistant to nalidixic acid,
sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim,
while only 8% (n = 4) showed multidrug resistance to
seven antimicrobials, namely ampicillin, gentamicin,
nalidixic acid, neomycin, sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline, and trimethoprim.



_Detection of qnr genes_

Four _S._ Derby isolates from chickens showed
reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and were
susceptible to nalidixic acid. All four harbored the
_qnrS1_ gene. The _qnrS1_ positive _S_ . Derby were from
farm K (n = 1), farm I (n = 2), and farm F (n = 1).


**Discussion**

In this study, the overall positive isolation rate of
_Salmonella_ species from human blood samples is
comparable with that from Ethiopia (4%) [30] but
higher than those from Kenya (1%) [31] and
Mozambique (2%) [32]. On the other hand, higher
rates have been reported from Congo (7%) [33] and
Malawi (6% and 8%) [15,34]. The skewed
distribution of 1:0.5 between males and females is
difficult to explain, but may be caused by the fact that
more males were examined or that the male
population has a higher susceptibility to infections.

Our data reveals the relative importance of
_Salmonella_ associated with human bacteraemia
predominated by _S._ Enteritidis and _S_ . Typhimurium
in Ibadan, Nigeria. Similar trends have been observed
in African countries where _S._ Enteritidis and _S_ .
Typhimurium are the most common serovars causing
human salmonellosis [9,11,13,15,35-40]. It is
interesting to note that the majority of the _S_ .
Enteritidis and _S_ . Dublin were isolated from hospitals
A, B, and C, whereas the remaining hospitals found
very few. _S_ . Typhimurium was mostly isolated from
hospital B. Kariuki _et al._ found that the main serovars
obtained from children with bacteraemia in Kenya
were _S._ Enteritidis (55%) and _S_ . Typhimurium (33%)

compared to other non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ [38].
Similar trends have been observed elsewhere [7,10].

Epidemic increase in prevalence of _S_ .
Typhimurium has recently been linked to circulation
of a particular MLST clone, ST313, in sub-Saharan
African countries [13]; however, it has not been
determined if the _S_ . Typhimurium ST313 clone has
spread to Ibadan, Nigeria. A future study will reveal
if this is the case or if the isolates belong to the
previously described clone of phage type U282 [39].
Similarly, the clonality of invasive _S_ . Enteritidis also
needs to be investigated to determine whether certain
clones are responsible for causing bacteraemia
compared to those causing mild gastroenteritis. It is
also noteworthy that neither _S._ Enteritidis nor _S_ .
Typhimurium was isolated from chickens included in
this study, indicating that intensively raised chickens
are not reservoirs for invasive serovars in humans. It
should be noted, however, that the samples obtained
from chickens were collected in 2007, compared to
the samples from humans, which were collected from
2004 to 2005. In 2004, _S_ . Enteritidis and _S_ .
Typhimurium were isolated by Orji _et al._ from
poultry droppings and beef [41].

_S_ . Dublin was not reported as an important cause
of invasive salmonellosis in some sub-Saharan
African countries [9,11,13,15,35-38], but this serovar
constitutes an important human pathogen in Upper
Volta [42]. _S_ . Dublin is host-adapted to cattle and is
highly invasive; it is transmitted to humans through
beef, cheese, and raw milk [43-45]. In many
European countries, surveillance shows that _S._ Dublin
is the most commonly isolated serovar from bovine
meat, exceeding the level of _S._ Typhimurium [46].
Only a few publications have described _S_ . Dublin in
animals from Nigeria and all of them also associate
the serovar to cattle [47,48]. Cattle farming is a
thriving business in Nigeria because beef meat is
highly consumed, either in soup dishes or roasted
(suya); other products such as raw milk and cheese
are heavily consumed in Nigeria without adequate
control measures to prevent spread of zoonotic agents
to human. It would be interesting to determine the
occurrence of _S_ . Dublin among cattle in Nigeria.

The study further reveals that _S_ . Typhi still
constitutes a significant public health importance in
Ibadan, Nigeria; therefore, appropriate control
measures, such as vaccination and food safety
measurements, need to be put in place. Overall, the
study supports the conclusions of other publications
which report that invasive salmonellosis caused by



NTS is of greater public health importance than the _S_ .
Typhi [9].

Rarely isolated _Salmonella_ serovars such as _S_ .
Apapa, _S_ . Mouschaui, _S._ Jukestown, and _S_ .
Oritamerin were observed causing invasive
salmonellosis in humans. Severe human
salmonellosis caused by those serovars has been
previously linked to exposure to reptiles and
amphibians [49-54]. Several studies have shown that
reptiles are reservoirs for _Salmonella_ that are able to
affect humans and recently constitute a significant
public health problem in many countries due to
captive pet reptiles [55-57]; however, the majority of
infections in Nigeria are not caused by captive pet
reptiles but more likely by household wall lizards.
Lizards are found around houses in Nigeria, most
commonly in the rural areas and sometimes inside
houses, thus constituting a potential health risk.
Additionally, snake meat is a special delicacy in
some parts of Nigeria, while snakes are revered in
other places. It is interesting to note that all the rarely
isolated serovars obtained, with the exception of _S_ .
Apapa, were isolated from samples at more rural
sampling sites, thus suggesting that the sources of
infections were associated with reptiles or the
environment. Wall geckos have been previously
described as a reservoir of _Salmonella_ in Nigeria,
constituting a public health problem [58,59] that is
difficult to control due to the nature of wild animals.
Consequently, the potential risk of invasive
salmonellosis due to the exposure to reptiles and
amphibians should be disseminated to the people at
risk in rural areas.

The majority of the human isolates were resistant
to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim;
high resistance was also observed to
chloramphenicol. Multidrug resistance to these old
and commonly used antimicrobials is a public health
problem [60] and could facilitate usage of
fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins
for empiric treatment. _S_ . Typhimurium was the most
resistant of the serovars obtained from human blood
samples and exhibited resistance to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline, and trimethoprim. In many ways, the _S_ .
Typhimurium isolates in this study match the
resistance profile of the multidrug-resistant invasive
_S_ . Typhimurium ST313 clone found in sub-Saharan
Africa [13]. This hypothesis needs to be further
investigated by MLST typing before it is concluded.

It is interesting that all the isolates of _S_ . Typhi
were susceptible to all the tested antibiotics,


490

suggesting the efficacy of old antimicrobials for
treatment of typhoid fever.

The overall prevalence rate (11%) of _Salmonella_
spp. from chicken fecal samples is high and with
prevalence rates of 26% and 15% in farms J and K,
respectively. Similarly, high prevalence rates have
also been reported from Maiduguri, northern Nigeria

[20], and a high rate (37%) of _Salmonella_
contamination of broiler farms has been reported
from Algeria [61]. Chicken is also a predominant
source of _Salmonella_ in Europe and has warranted
initiation of targeted control measures [46,62], thus
suggesting chickens as important reservoirs of
_Salmonella_ in Nigeria. The cause of the high
prevalence rate in farms J and K is unknown due to
limited data.

In this study, the predominant serovar in chicken
was _S_ . Virchow, which is one of the most common
serovars in chicken [46,61,63-67]. In Europe, _S_ .
Virchow was listed as the seventh most common
serovar isolated from broiler meat in 2007 [46]. _S_ .
Virchow was observed in all farms expect G, with a
high prevalence of 24% and 13% in farms J and K.
Interestingly, _S_ . Enteritidis was not isolated from
chicken in this study. In contrast, _S_ . Enteritidis is the
most predominant serovar in _Gallus Gallus_ flocks in
the European Union, with a prevalence of 38% [46].
This difference may be explained by differences in
export patterns, production systems, climate, or feed.
Recently, _S_ . Hiduddify, a rare serovar, was found to
be the predominant serovar in chickens in Maiduguri,
Northern Nigeria [20], but was also not isolated in the
fecal samples of chickens in this study. Northern
Nigeria is generally warmer than the region of this
study; moreover, the chickens studied by Raufu _et al._
were largely free range in contrast to the intensively
reared chickens we studied, which this may suggest
the presence of _S_ . Hiduddify in the environment
where chickens likely pick up the serovar from
foodstuffs as they scavenge for foods in the
environment. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed
in free-range chickens in the south or by investigation
of the environment in Maiduguri, Nigeria. We also
isolated _S_ . Onireke, a rare serovar in chickens from
Ibadan, Nigeria. We speculate that those rare isolates
found in chicken also originate from reptiles or the
environment like the rare serovars obtained from
invasive _Salmonella_ in humans, but further research
is needed to explore this hypothesis.

Although none of the serovars obtained from
chicken fecal samples was isolated from the analysed
human blood samples, those serovars still constitute



potential serious health risks for humans in Ibadan,
Nigeria. In Europe, _S._ Virchow and _S_ . Derby are
among the ten most frequent serovars causing human
salmonellosis [46] and may be found in human stool
samples from Ibadan, Nigeria, if investigated. A
plausible explanation for why we could not link any
of the serovars obtained from chickens to humans
may be due to the analysis of human blood and
chicken fecal samples in different years, suggesting
time-based shifts in the prevalence of serovars.
Analysis of blood samples from only humans could
also be responsible because all serovars of NTS are
not equally invasive.

The _Salmonella_ isolates from chickens were
more commonly resistant to tetracycline,
sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim;
this resistance may be attributed to indiscriminate use
of antibiotics at recommended doses or at
subtherapeutic doses as feed additives to promote
growth, and as chemotherapeutic agents to control
epizootics on the farms [68]. The high level of
resistance to nalidixic acid coupled with the high
level of reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin is
worrisome because fluoroquinolones are strategic in
the treatment of invasive salmonellosis [60]. The
most resistant serovar from chicken was _S_ . Virchow;
this serovar is usually multiple resistant to
antimicrobials [64,65,69]. These observations call for
regulation of antibiotic usage in Nigeria to stem the
spread of resistance to antimicrobials. The finding of
_qnrS1_ in _S_ . Derby is another public concern because
_qnr_ genes mediate resistance to fluoroquinolones,
which can compromise treatment with
fluoroquinolones [60]; furthermore, _qnr_ location on
mobile genetic elements coupled with indiscriminate
use of antibiotics in Nigeria will facilitate selection
and potential spread to other serovars [70].


**Conclusion**

This study reports the relative importance of _S._
Enteritidis, _S_ . Typhimurium, and _S._ Dublin associated
with human bacteraemia in Ibadan, Nigeria, and that
_S_ . Typhi still constitutes a significant public health
risk. This is the first time that _S_ . Dublin has been
reported as an important cause of invasive
salmonellosis in sub-Saharan African countries. We
also observed rarely isolated _Salmonella_ serovars
previously associated with reptiles causing invasive
salmonellosis in humans.

As observed elsewhere in Nigeria, we can
confirm the high prevalence rates of _Salmonella_ spp.
from chicken fecal samples, with _S_ . Virchow as the

predominant serovar. None of the serovars obtained
from chicken fecal samples was isolated from the
analyzed human blood samples; those serovars still
constitute potential serious health risks for humans in
Nigeria and should be controlled by targeted
interventions.

A high level of reduced susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin and resistance to nalidixic acid was
observed in all serovars isolated from chickens.
Additionally, we detected the plasmid mediated
quinolone resistance gene, _qnrS1_, in _S_ . Derby.
