Antimicrobials on the WHO's critically important antimicrobials list (2012) were selected for testing according to their importance to human and animal health (FAO/WHO/OIE, 2008; WHO, 2009). One loopful of colony material was subcultured in 5 ml Mueller-Hinton broth for an overnight at 35°C, vortexed well and adjusted to obtain a turbidity comparable to that of 0.5 McFarland opacity standard (bioMe'rieux, Marcy 1'Etoile, France). The bacterial suspensions were streaked on MHA plates with a cotton swab and with an antibiotic disc dispenser, the discs were placed on the agar surface, plates were incubated at 37°C, the standard temperature used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, for 24 h, and the diameter of the inhibition zones was measured. The isolates were classified as sensitive, intermediate and resistant based on the diameter of the clearing zone according to CLSI (2012) guidelines. The antibiotic discs represented nine classes of antibiotics: ampicillin-subbactam, methicillin, penicillin, and oxacillin (Penicillins); chloramphenicol (Chloramphenicols); ciprofloxacin (Florinated quinolones); clindamycin (Lincosamides); gentamycin (Aminoglycosides); erythromycin (Macrolides); sulphamethoxazole (trimethoprim (Sulphonamides)); tetracycline (Tetracyclines); vancomycin (Glycopeptides). S. aureus ATCC 29213 (β-lactamase positive), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (β-lactamase negative) were used as quality control.
