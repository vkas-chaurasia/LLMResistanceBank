DISCUSSION
The present study evaluated the microbial quality of raw (Kagambèga et al., 2011; Abd el-Aziz, 2013). Also, it was
meat sold in different markets of Ouagadougou. This observed that Salmonella was most prevalent in beef. All
finding detected the prevalence of (19%) for Salmonella previous studies showed that Salmonella was widely
spp. in beef, mutton and intestines raw meats slaughtered distributed in retail meat globally, which increased
for human consumption in Burkina Faso. Previous study salmonellosis following consumption of contaminated
in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Brazil and Iran were found that meat or cross-contamination. In Burkina Faso, sheep and
raw meat of beef and chicken sold in open market were others animals were mostly roam freely at pasture in the
contaminated respectively by 9%, 29%, 29% and 19% of bush (Kagambèga et al., 2013). The risk of contamination
Salmonella (Iroha et al., 2011; Kagambèga et al., 2011; may be higher if beef meat or mutton is consumed
Carvalho et al., 2013; Sodagari et al., 2015). Rate of undercooked (Sodagari et al., 2015). The prevalence may
Salmonella reported in beef (27%) are higher than mutton be based by diversity in sampling methods, sampling
(11%) (p = 0.0150). As far as intestines are concerned, seasons and techniques (Li et al., 2013). However, some
the proportions of Salmonella are lower in beef intestine variations may be due to several factors, sanitation within
(18%) than sheep intestine (22%) (p = 0.635). The the slaughterhouse, and the cross-contamination of
incidence of Salmonella in meats products obtained by carcasses by contact with intestinal tracts during
other authors varied between 0 and 100% in Russia, slaughter or processing and differences among isolation

in food animals and in raw meat products has relevant study indicates the need for an improvement in the
public health implications (Tassew et al., 2010). In microbiological quality of meat. There is also a need for a
Burkina Faso, in 2011, study conducted by Kagambèga comprehensive epidemiological study and control of

where as in this study, Salmonella was found at 19%. As production in Burkina Faso. Resistance rates of
observed in this study, the reasons for the higher Salmonella are varied from animals’ sample. The
incidence of Salmonella contamination can be due to the Salmonella resistance rates to ticarcillin, tetracycline and
widespread habit of raw meat treatment, the common cefalotin found in this study was higher than resistance
factors such as overcrowding, poverty, inadequate rates to others antimicrobials because of the overuse of
sanitary conditions, and poor general hygiene these antimicrobials for treatment and growth promotion
