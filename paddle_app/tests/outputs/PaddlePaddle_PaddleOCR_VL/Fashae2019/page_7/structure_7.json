It is also noteworthy that neither S. Enteritidis nor S.

It should be noted, however, that the samples obtained from chickens were collected in 2007, compared to the samples from humans, which were collected from 2004 to 2005. In 2004, S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium were isolated by Orji et al. from poultry droppings and beef  $ [41] $ .",

Cattle farming is a thriving business in Nigeria because beef meat is highly consumed, either in soup dishes or roasted (suya); other products such as raw milk and cheese are heavily consumed in Nigeria without adequate control measures to prevent spread of zoonotic agents to human.

Severe human salmonellosis caused by those serovars has been previously linked to exposure to reptiles and amphibians  $ [49-54] $ . Several studies have shown that reptiles are reservoirs for Salmonella that are able to affect humans and recently constitute a significant public health problem in many countries due to captive pet reptiles  $ [55-57] $ ; however, the majority of infections in Nigeria are not caused by captive pet reptiles but more likely by household wall lizards. Lizards are found around houses in Nigeria, most commonly in the rural areas and sometimes inside houses, thus constituting a potential health risk. Additionally, snake meat is a special delicacy in some parts of Nigeria, while snakes are revered in other places. It is interesting to note that all the rarely isolated serovars obtained, with the exception of S. Apapa, were isolated from samples at more rural sampling sites, thus suggesting that the sources of infections were associated with reptiles or the environment. Wall geckos have been previously described as a reservoir of Salmonella in Nigeria, constituting a public health problem  $ [58,59] $  that is difficult to control due to the nature of wild animals. Consequently, the potential risk of invasive salmonellosis due to the exposure to reptiles and amphibians should be disseminated to the people at risk in rural areas.",

S.

In many ways, the S. Typhimurium isolates in this study match the resistance profile of the multidrug-resistant invasive S. Typhimurium ST313 clone found in sub-Saharan Africa  $ [13] $ .
