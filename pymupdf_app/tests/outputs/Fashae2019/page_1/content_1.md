**Abstract**
Background: This study determines the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of _Salmonella_ serovars from humans and chickens in Ibadan,
Nigeria, in 2004-2007.
Methodology: A total of 991 blood samples were collected from patients in 2004 to 2005 and 641 fecal samples were collected from poultry
farms in 2007. All _Salmonella_ isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility.
Results: Thirty-nine (4%) _Salmonella_ isolates were obtained from human blood and 70 (11%) from chicken fecal samples. The human
isolates revealed nine different serovars; 82% were non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ and 18% were ( _S_ . Typhi). The majority of serovars from
humans were _S_ . Enteritidis (33%), _S_ . Dublin (18%), and _S_ . Typhimurium (18%). Resistance to chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole,
trimethoprim, and ampicillin ranged from 36% to 59% for the human isolates.
Eight different serovars were obtained from chickens; _S_ . Virchow (71%) predominated. A high frequency (87%) of reduced susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin was observed among the chicken isolates. A high frequency of resistance to tetracycline (93%), nalidixic acid (81%), and
sulfamethoxazole (87%) was observed. Rare serovars such as _S_ . Apapa, _S_ . Mouschaui, _S._ Jukestown, _S_ . Oritamerin, and _S_ . Onireke were
isolated from both humans and chickens. Identical serovars were not found among human and chicken isolates.
Conclusions: This study indicates that chickens are not a reservoir of _Salmonella_ causing bacteraemia among humans in Ibadan, Nigeria.
Studies locating the reservoirs responsible for invasive salmonellosis in humans are needed. Controls and targeted interventions against _S_ .
Virchow and the frequent occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in chickens should be initiated to prevent the spread of this serovar.

**Introduction** severe [7]. The ability of _Salmonella_ to cause



_Salmonella enterica_ is an important food-borne
pathogen that is currently divided into 2,587
serotypes [1]. The typhiodal _Salmonella_ serovars are
host-restricted human pathogens and include
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi and _S_ . Paratyphi

[2]. Non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ (NTS) are zoonotic
agents and a wide variety of animals have been
identified as reservoirs [3-5]. Poultry are considered
as one of the most common vehicles of human
salmonellosis [6].

Salmonellosis is often associated with
gastroenteritis, which is usually self-limiting. In some
cases, particularly in children, the elderly, and
immunocompromised patients, _Salmonella_ infection
can lead to invasive and focal infections that can be



severe [7]. The ability of _Salmonella_ to cause
invasive infection varies with the serovar, the age of
patient, and region. _S_ . Typhi and _S_ . Paratyphi A are
highly invasive for both children and adults. Certain
serovars of NTS, such as _S_ . Choleraesuis, _S_ . Dublin,
and _S_ . Virchow, have higher abilities than other
serovars to cause invasive salmonellosis [8-10]. In
sub-Saharan Africa, NTS invasive infections are a
public health concern for infants, young children, and
young adults suffering from malnutrition, malaria,
and HIV infection [11-13]. Most human infections
are caused by a limited number of serovars, which
may vary from country to country and over time. The
predominant serovars in some African countries
include _S._ Enteritidis, _S_ . Typhimurium, _S._ Concord,
and _S_ . Isangi [10,12-16].
