the present study, we report here the presence of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Kentucky in the studied flocks that coincide with its emergence in other countries throughout Africa and the Middle East. However, the low number of isolates that may be due to limitation of the Algerian area studied does not allow assessing the potential introduction of ciprofloxacin Kentucky clone at a national level. Six risk indicators were identified as being potentially linked to the Salmonella contamination of laying-hen houses. Most have already been reported as potential risk factors for Salmonella contamination in laying-hen flocks. In the future, these initial findings may be used as the basis for national epidemiological studies to determine the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in Algerian laying-hen flocks and to investigate the risk indicators implicated in Salmonella spp contamination, the different serovars present and even any relationship between egg production and human outbreaks of Salmonella.
