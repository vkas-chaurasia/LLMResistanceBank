warm blooded animals, commensal _E. coli_ from
humans and animals can cause extra intestinal
infections and are a potential reservoir of antimicrobial
resistance genes [15]. These bacterial strains,
especially when they carry mobile genetic elements
such as plasmids, transposons and integrons, can play
important roles in the dissemination of transmissible
resistance genes [16].

Little is known about the factors contributing to
the problem of antibiotic resistance in Nigeria. This is
partly because there is a dearth of information on the
types, quantity and frequency of antibiotics used in
farm animal production system in Nigeria. Very little
is also known about the antibiotic resistance profile of
bacteria (such as _E. coli_ ) commonly associated with


**Table 1.** Description of study farms



animal production systems in Nigeria despite the
growing global concern about the transmission of
antibiotic resistant bacteria through the food animal
production chain. The few studies that have
investigated antibiotic resistance in _E. coli_ from the
poultry production system in Nigeria stopped at
phenotypic level without a corresponding investigation
of the molecular mechanisms of resistance [17]. Yet
such studies are warranted because of the potentials of
_E. coli_ as reservoirs of transferable antibiotic
resistance genes that could be disseminated into
human populations as a result of the contact with
animal wastes. This study therefore investigated
antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular mechanisms
of resistance in _E. coli_ isolated from eight poultry
