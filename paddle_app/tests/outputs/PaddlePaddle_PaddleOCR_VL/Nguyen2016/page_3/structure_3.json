Amplification reactions were carried out in a TRIO Thermoblock cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) using the following programme: one cycle of 1 min at 96  $ ^{\\circ} $ C was followed by 35 cycles each consisting of 60 s at 95  $ ^{\\circ} $ C of denaturation, 90 s at 59  $ ^{\\circ} $ C of annealing, and 60 s at 72  $ ^{\\circ} $ C of elongation. The PCR was terminated after a final extension step of 5 min. at 72  $ ^{\\circ} $ C. Amplification generated 857, 589, 522, and 462 base pair DNA fragments specific for the genus Campylobacter and the species C. jejuni, C. lari, and C. coli, respectively. For analysis, 20  $ \\mu $ l of PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5 % agarose gel for 1 h, stained with ethidium bromide (0.5  $ \\mu $ g/ml), and visualized under UV light. Results were documented using BioImage system GeneGenius (Syngene, Synoptics Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Reference strains C. jejuni DSM 4688, C. coli DSM 4689, and C. lari DSM 11375 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) were used as positive controls.",

The MIC values were detected using different concentration ranges as previously described  $ [23] $ . Briefly, Campylobacter isolates grown on Mueller–Hinton agar (Oxoid GmbH) supplemented with 10 % bovine blood under microaerophilic conditions were suspended in NaCl solution (0.9 %) to obtain a turbidity corresponding to a McFarland standard of 0.5 (Dr. Lange, CADAS photometer 30, Berlin, Germany). One-hundred and fifty milliliters of the above suspension were diluted with 10 ml Mueller–Hinton broth (Oxoid GmbH) resulting in a concentration of approximately  $ 10^{6}-10^{7} $  colony forming units (cfu)/ml. One hundred milliliters of the inoculum was filled in each well of the plate; the plates were sealed and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under microaerophilic conditions. Results were read either visually or photometrically (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany) using the computer program easyWIN fitting (version V6.1, 2000). C. jejuni DSM 4688 and C. coli DSM 4689 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH) were included in each batch of broth microdilution assay for quality control. The lowest concentration of antibiotics that prevents visible growth of the microorganism is defined as the MIC.",
