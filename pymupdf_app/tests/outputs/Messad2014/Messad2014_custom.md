1. Introduction



a b s t r a c t


Campylobacteriosis in humans is caused by thermotolerant Campylobacter spp, following consumption of
contaminated poultry, most commonly broiler.
The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of contamination by thermotolerant Campylobacter
and to characterize antimicrobial resistance of the strains isolated from broilers in some farms and
slaughterhouses in the region of Algiers.
One hundred droppings samples, 100 contents of ceaca and 100 neck skins were taken from six poultry
farms and five slaughterhouses, than analyzed according to NF. ISO 10272-1/1995 norm and the OIE
recommendations. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined according to the guidelines of the CASFM/2010 by disc diffusion method.
Thermotolerant Campylobacter strains were isolated from 85%, 98%, and 80% of droppings, caecal
content and neck skin, respectively. All the strains (100%) were resistant to nalidixic acid and sensitive to
gentamicin and to chloramphenicol. 83.7% of them were resistant to tetracycline and to ciprofloxacin,
75.3% to ampicillin, 46.8% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 21.7% were resistant to erythromycin. All the
isolates showed a multi-drug resistance. Nineteen different profiles were identified with “AM, AMC, NA,
CIP, TE” combination as the most common profile identified for 27% (n ¼ 74) of isolated strains. In
addition, 15% of the strains were resistant to both erythromycin and ciprofloxacin, which are systematically used in treatment of human Campylobacter infections.
Our results showed a high prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter with multidrug resistance
profiles in poultry farms and slaughterhouses of Algiers. These results stress that the risk of human
contamination throughout the food chain is very high, which may generate: i) a danger of food poisoning
by ingestion of chicken meat and chicken meat products and, ii) a cross-resistance to antibiotics between
human and avian strains.

In human health, Campylobacter is considered as the major
cause of diarrheal illnesses and, the most common bacterial cause
of gastroenteritis in the world (Bolla & Garnotel, 2008), causing up
to 14% of diarrhea worldwide. It is estimated that 2.5 million of the
diarrhea worldwide occur each year, resulting in 13,000 hospitalizations and 124 deaths (Braam, 2004).

In western Algeria, a caseecontrol study in infants showed that
Campylobacter were isolated in 17.7% of the 411 patients and in
14.9% of the 247 controls (Megraud et al.,1990). However, no official
data concerning contamination of poultry or other food products in
Algeria is available.
Compared to Salmonella, Campylobacter isolation frequency
from human diarrheal stool samples is generally similar or higher;
thus they represent a major problem in microbiological food safety.
Campylobacter’s ubiquitous nature and extent of adaptation to wild,
farm animals and pets, contribute to the introduction and persistence of this bacteria in different biotopes and to contamination of
the foodstuffs (Federighi, 2005, pp. 145e167). While numerous
potential vehicles of transmission exist, commercial chicken meat




S. Messad et al. / Food Control 40 (2014) 324e328 325



has been identified as one of the most important food vehicles for
these organisms. Preparation of raw poultry and consumption of
contaminated chicken meat or chicken products in general have
been identified as the main risk factor for human infection with
Campylobacter (Hartnett et al., 2009, 33 p.). Sporadic human cases
have been associated with consumption of under-cooked poultry
meat, while larger outbreaks are associated with raw milk (Denis
et al., 2011; Karagiannis et al., 2010). Acute self-limited gastrointestinal illness, characterized by diarrhea, fever and abdominal
cramps, is the most common presentation of Campylobacter infection; fresh blood may appear in the stools. Local complications such
as cholecystitis, pancreatitis and peritonitis occur rarely. It has been
recognized that GuillaineBarré syndrome is the most serious
complication of Campylobacter infection, with an incidence of 1/
1000 infections (Butzler, 2004).
Campylobacter diseases are primarily treated with fluoroquinolones and macrolides. However, an increase of acquired
resistance to these same antibiotics has been reported by the European food safety authority (EFSA, 2010a). Because of their ability
to be transmitted to humans through food chain, the zoonotic
enteropathogenic bacteria resistant to antibiotics, mainly
Campylobacter, are more dangerous in terms of human health. In
the U.S.A, consumption of poultry has been identified as a risk
factor for human infection by fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species (Luangtongkum et al., 2009).
Our study aims to determine the thermotolerants Campylobacter
prevalence in broiler in some poultry farms and slaughterhouses of
Algiers and the susceptibility of isolated strains to several
antibiotics.


2. Material and methods


2.1. Samples collection


Our study was conducted from January to December, 2010. 300
samples were collected from six poultry farms representing about
the tenth of poultry buildings in this region, and from five slaughterhouses representing the quarter of the abattoirs of this region,
randomly chosen in the Algiers region. The poultry farms have
livestock capacity between 4000 and 6000 subjects, while the processing capacity of the slaughterhouses are between 600 and 1200
subjects per hour. First, at the end of rearing period, from six poultry
farms,100 freshly emitted droppings samples were collected during
the last week preceding removal; second, on five slaughterhouses,
after chickens evisceration, 100 samples of caeca were taken and,
100 fresh broiler chicken neck skins were collected at the end of
slaughtering chain. Both cecal contents and neck skin samples were
collected from the same slaughter batch (animals had the same
origin and were sampled randomly in the slaughterhouse line). For
each farm and slaughterhouse, a single visit was performed early in
the morning; the samples were placed in sterile plastic pots (droppings and cecal contents) and sterile plastic bags (neck skins) inside
an isothermal cool-box at þ4 [�] C and transferred immediately to the
laboratory in order to be analyzed on the same day.


2.2. Isolation and identification


The isolation and identification of thermotolerant Campylobacter were performed according to World Organisation for Animal
Health recommendations (OIE, 2008) and to French Agency for
Standardization: NF ISO 10272-1: 1995 norm (AFNOR, 2004, 15 p.)
using the following procedures.
All cultures and incubations were performed under microaerobic
condition which was generated by using an anaerobic jar containing
a gas generating CampyGen� reagents (Oxoïd, Dardily. France).



Culture of Campylobacter took place within 4 h after samples
collection. From droppings and caecal contents the research of
thermotolerant Campylobacter was performed by direct isolation
on Butzler selective agar medium (Oxoïd, Dardily. France) and
incubated at 42 [�] C for 48 h.
From neck skin samples, isolation on Butzler agar was preceded
by a selective enrichment step of sample: 10 g of sample in 90 mL of
Preston broth (Oxoïd, Dardily. France) and incubated for 24 h at
42 [�] C. The culture dishes were then inoculated with a few drops of
Preston broth, incubated at 42 [�] C and read every 24 h up to fifth
day.
The control strains were: Campylobacter jejuni (CIP 70.2),
Campylobacter coli (CIP 70.80) and C. fetus (CIP 53.96) (Institut
Pasteur Paris Collection, France).
Curved Gram-negative bacilli, with typical motility (twirling
and rapid darting movements), oxidase positive, catalase positive
and which did not show growth at 25 [�] C were presumed thermotolerant Campylobacter in the preliminary identification.
Suspect colonies of Campylobacter were subsequently purified
on Columbia agar (Bio-Rad, Marnes la coquette. France) with 5%
horse blood (IPA: Institut Pasteur d’Algérie. Algiers, Algeria), and
confirmed both by using biochemical test on Triple Sugar Iron agar
(IPA; Algiers, Algeria) and sensitivity to cephalothin (30 mg) (BioRad, Marnes La Coquette. France).


2.3. Antibiotic sensitivity analysis


Antimicrobial sensitivity of Campylobacter strains was assessed
using the disk diffusion assay. All isolates were tested with the
following antibiotics: ampicillin (10 mg), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
(20/10 mg), gentamicin (10 mg), erythromycin (15 IU), nalidixic acid
(30 mg), ciprofloxacin (5 mg), tetracycline (30 mg) and chloramphenicol (30 mg) (Bio-Rad, Marnes La Coquette. France), the choice
of tested antibiotics was carried out according to the guidelines of
the CA-SFM/2010 and according to the standardization of the
antibiogram in human medicine on a national scale (WHO, 2008b,
102 p.).
Bacterial suspension of 0.5 McFarland was prepared from a pure
18 h culture, than seeded by swabbing. The isolated strains were
inoculated on Mueller-Hinton agar (Bio-Rad, Marnes La Coquette.
France) supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood. After
deposition of antibiotics disks, the plates were incubated at 42 [�] C
for 24e48 h in microaerophilic atmosphere. Inhibition zones were
measured by a caliper and diameters were interpreted as recommended by the Antibiogram committee of the French Society of
Microbiology (CA-SFM, 2010, 50 p.). For quality control reason,
reference strains E. coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC
25923 were tested concomitantly with samples.


2.4. Statistical analysis


Chi-square test was used for comparisons in order to determine
if there were statistically significant differences at 95% level in the
prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter samples between the
farms and between the slaughterhouses and to compare antimicrobial resistance rates. Significant differences were considered
when probability (p) was equal to or less than a risk (p � 0.05).


3. Results


3.1. Thermotolerant Campylobacter Prevalence in tested poultry
farms and slaughterhouses


Among 300 tested samples, 263 were positive to thermotolerant
Campylobacter, which represent an overall prevalence of 87.7%.




326 S. Messad et al. / Food Control 40 (2014) 324e328



Campylobacter were isolated in 85% (n ¼ 85) of droppings samples,
98% (n ¼ 98) of ceacal contents and 80% (n ¼ 80) of neck skins;
indeed no statistically difference was identified between rates
(p > 0.05). All samples issued from five farms were positive to
thermotolerant Campylobacter, whereas no strain has been isolated
from the sixth one. Campylobacter was isolated from both types of
samples in all slaughterhouses (Table 1).


3.2. Antibiotic susceptibility of isolated strains


All isolated strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, and susceptible to gentamycin and to chloramphenicol. 83.7% (n ¼ 220) were
resistant to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, 75.3% (n ¼ 198) to
ampicillin, 46.8% (n ¼ 123) to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and 21.7%
(n ¼ 57) to erythromycin (Table 2). Resistance rates among antibiotics used for the same type of sample showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) but there was no significant difference between
the strains isolated from feces, cecal contents and those isolated
from neck skins to the same antibiotic.
Moreover, all isolates showed a multidrug resistance to antibiotics (resistance to two antibiotics or more), 5.7% (n ¼ 15) resistant
to two antibiotics, 27.4% (n ¼ 72) to three antibiotics, 24.7% (n ¼ 65)
to four antibiotics, 36.9% (n ¼ 97) to five antibiotics and 5.3%
(n ¼ 14) to six antibiotics. Indeed, nineteen different resistance
profiles were noted, with “ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline” combination as the most
common profile identified for 27% (n ¼ 74) of isolated strains, 15%
(n ¼ 38) of isolates were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and
erythromycin (Table 3).


4. Discussion


4.1. Thermotolerant Campylobacter prevalence


Bacteriological analysis of samples showed in a part, high intestinal carriage of Campylobacter in broiler (98%) with a high rate
of contaminated carcasses (80%). The intestinal carriage is due to
the fact that these enteric bacteria are adapted to live in digestive
tract mucus (Megraud & Bultel, 2004). The prevalence of positive
broiler flocks in the European Community was estimated to 75%
(EFSA, 2010a, 2011, 2012). According to the Swiss report of zoonoses, Campylobacter were recovered from all tested chicken flocks in
Switzerland (Luginbühl, Marthaler, Geiser, Lutz, & Danuser, 2010).

The prevalence of Campylobacter was in agreement with previous
studies in Iran (Ansari Lari et al., 2011). However it remains fairly
high compared to that reported by Chena et al. in 2010 in China.
In this survey, of the five farms, all samples were contaminated,
this suggests a horizontal transmission. It has been reported that all
chickens are infected one week after introduction of bacteria in
poultry building (Shreeve, Toszeghy, Pattison, & Newell, 2000).
Chickens are coprophagous and fecal excretion is probably an
important factor in spread of microbes in poultry flocks (Usha et al.,
2010). This result can also be related to high animal density, which
promotes contact between animals especially those carrying
Campylobacter (Megraud & Bultel, 2004). In addition to sources
such as soiled litter, untreated water, other farm animals, wild
birds, insects, as well as the human flow, Viable Non-Cultivable
forms were associated to Campylobacter transmission in broilers,
which would in turn be responsible for transmission of these microorganisms to the environment (Humphrey, O’Brien, & Madsen,
2007).
Although, horizontal transmission of Campylobacter in the
environment of breeding seems to be the main track, vertical
transmission of Campylobacter from parent to their chicks is not
ruled out (Pearson et al., 1996).
One of the studied farms that received a food supplemented
with organic acids was free from Campylobacter which suggests
that supplementation with organic acids could be indirectly
involved in protection as demonstrated by Chaveerach,
Keuzenkamp, Urlings, Lipman, and Knapen, in 2002 and Solis de
los Santos et al. in 2009. These molecules have been recommended by an expert report of the FAO/WHO (Food and agriculture
organization/World Health Organization) as a means of hazard
control of Campylobacter in chicken meat (Anonymous, 2001, 53 p.).
In slaughterhouses, contamination of neck skin could be related
directly to gut contents of the same animal and/or to cross
contamination throughout slaughtering equipment. This contamination may occur in the scalding tanks, in feather removal machine
or during evisceration (Ghafir & Daube, 2007; Posch et al., 2006).
The nature of slaughter processing makes it impossible to prevent
cross-contamination of negative batches by positive batches
(Frediani & Stephan, 2003; Ono & Yamamoto, 1999). In a previous
study in Algeria, 66% of chicken neck skins were contaminated
(Mouffok & Lebres, 1992). Our results are similar to those reported
in Brazil by Franchin, Ogliari, and Batista, in 2007 with a contamination rate of 84.7%.


4.2. Antimicrobial resistance of isolated strains


High susceptibility to gentamicin and chloramphenicol could be
explained by none or moderate use of these antibiotics due to due
to the no registration in Algeria since 2006 (WHO, 2008a, 100 p.).
High levels of resistance were observed towards different antibiotics including nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and
ampicillin (antibiotics widely used in tested farms) which shows
similarity of our results compared to those reported by EFSA
(2010b). By contrast, no antibiotic resistance against ampicillin,
erythromycin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid have previously been
observed with strains isolated from droppings and neck skins of
broiler in the region of Algiers in 1992 (Mouffok & Lebres, 1992).
Several authors agree that the use of antibiotics in animals as
prophylactic, therapeutic agents or for growth promotion can select
for resistance and reduce the effectiveness of these products in
veterinary and human medicine, because of emergence of resistant
strains, which may occur during or after antimicrobial treatment
(Avrain et al., 2003; Rahimi, Momtaz, Ameri, Ghasemian-Safaei, &
Ali-Kasemi, 2010; Usha et al., 2010; WHO, 2008c, 5 p.). However,
the use of disinfectants or other biocides (Russell, 2002; EFSA,

2010b), and the environmental stresses encountered by bacteria
during the slaughter process (McMahon, Xu, Moore, Blair, &
McDowell, 2007) may also play a role in the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance.
21.7% of isolated strains were resistant to erythromycin, this
resistance remains low in industrialized countries, however,
resistant strains are frequently observed in developing countries,
including Thailand (50%) and Zimbabwe (14%) (WHO, 2003). In
another way, Lin et al. (2007) showed that erythromycin used in
low doses over a long period (which corresponds to their use as a
growth factor) selects for resistant strains of Campylobacter.
83.7% of isolated strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Several
studies have demonstrated the rapid development of mutants
resistant to fluoroquinolones in chickens infected with initially
fluoroquinolones susceptible Campylobacter, and treated with
enrofloxacin. Indeed, treatments of chickens do not eradicate the
organism but convert initially susceptible population to resistant
fluoroquinolones population which emerges as soon as 24 h from
start of treatment (Farnell et al., 2005; Han, Sahin, Barton, & Zhang,
2008; McDermott, Bodeis, & English, 2002; ).
The resistance to tetracycline was very frequent (83.7%) as reported by other authors (Bester & Essack, 2008; Mansouri-najand,
Saleha, & Wai, 2012; Tambur, Miljkovic-Selimovic, Doder, & Kulisic, 2010).

In Malaysia, resistance rates were higher than our results; 86%
was recorded to ampicillin, 82% to ciprofloxacin, 92% to tetracycline
and 99% to erythromycin and even with gentamicin (35%) (Tang,
Mohamad Ghazali, Saleha, Nishibuchi, & Son, 2009).
Roughly, Vandeplas et al. (2008) believe that changes in rates of
antimicrobial resistance between countries reflect various veterinary practices in antimicrobial use for treatment and prevention.
All our isolates were multi-drug resistant; we had identified a
dominant profile combining resistance to two beta-lactams, two
quinolones and tetracycline. In Belgium, the National Reference Laboratoryforfoodbornediseaseandantimicrobialresistanceofzoonotic
agents, announced that the percentages of strains multi-drug resistant of C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from chickens were 40% and 64%
respectively, the dominant profile was “nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin,
tetracycline” (Dierick, Botteldoorn, Denayer, & Naranjo, 2009).
15% of strains isolated in our study were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. These strains represent a critical
profiles, since these two antibiotics are the mostly used in
Campylobacter infections in humans (Engberg, Aarestrup, GernerSmidt, & Nachamkin, 2001; Luangtongkum et al. 2009). In addition to clinical troubles, transmission of multi-resistant Campylobacter to humans through food chain can also compromise the
effectiveness of treatment. Indeed, the EFSA has published a report
indicating that antimicrobial resistance phenomenon occurs in
most common zoonosis bacteria, particularly Campylobacter from
animals and food in the European Union (EFSA, 2010b).


5. Conclusion


Unlike other foodborne pathogens, Campylobacter are very susceptible to many environmental conditions, as concluded in this
survey, our results confirm that Campylobacter can survive well from
poultry farms to the plate of consumer and are of concern of food
poisoning. Indeed, intestinal carriage and neck skins contamination
rates in the present study showed high survival of Campylobacter in
farms, in slaughterhouses and carcasses. It revealed that antibiotic
resistant Campylobacter is common among chickens which can find
their way into the food chain. The recorded multi-drug resistant
campylobacters which was also reported to be common in other
countries reflect an alarming situation with regard to this phenomenonwhich may bedue tothewidespread use of antibioticsinpoultry
farming. As major source of human campylobacteriosis, prevention
should be focused on reducing Campylobacter infection at all stages of
poultry production chain, as well as for the controlling use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine in Algeria. Thus, there is an urgent
need for prudent use ofantibiotics inpoultry production to reduce the
development and spread of multi-drug resistant Campylobacter
which must be diligently monitored. Our results also emphasize the




328 S. Messad et al. / Food Control 40 (2014) 324e328



need for a surveillance and monitoring system for the prevalence and
antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter inbroiler, poultryand other
food animals.
