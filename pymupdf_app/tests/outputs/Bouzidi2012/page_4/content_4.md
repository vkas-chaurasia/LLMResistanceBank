N.A: No Access. Restricted house access by farmers for only one or 2 sampling visits.
DEP: the henhouse was depopulated when hens reached 66 weeks old.
a Four henhouses sampled at the end of lay for a first flocks and at the beginning and
the middle of lay in the subsequent flocks reared in the same henhouses.

and 5, respectively, Table 1): in feces from the first flocks (n=2) and
in dust samples in subsequent flocks in the same houses (n=4).
Thirteen isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial.
Twelve isolates exhibited resistance to nalidixic acid. Six isolates

All positive flocks (8/18)



were resistant to at least three different antibiotic classes. All three
S. Kentucky and two isolates of S. Hadar were resistant to ampicillin,
tetracycline and streptomycin, these five isolates being resistant to
cephalotin too. The three S. Kentucky isolates were also resistant
to fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were
tested, MICcipro ≥ 8 mg/L). S. Typhimurium was resistant to ampicillin. S. Manhattan, S. Virchow and S. Dublin isolates were 100%
susceptible to all tested antimicrobials (Table 2).


3.3. Risk indicators associated with the Salmonella status of flocks


Six out of fifteen risk indicators were considered as pertinent
indicators since their RR was ≥2. However, none was found to be
significantly related to contamination (p b 0.05; Table 3), probably
because of the small population. Salmonella contamination of flocks
was more frequent when (i) the layer house was easily accessible
(RR=3.5, CI 95%=0.5, 25; p=0.1), (ii) the buildings were not
disinfected before pullets were loaded (RR=2.7, CI 95%=0.4, 16.9,
p=0.2), (iii) ventilation was poor (RR=2.6; CI 95%=1.03, 6.5;
p=0.08), (iv) dead hens were stored on the farms for at least 1 week
(RR=2.6; CI 95%=1.0, 6.5; p=0.08), (v) we observed living or dead
rodents inside the henhouse on each sampling visit (RR=2.6; CI
95%=0.8, 7.6; p=0.08), and when (vi) cages were dry cleaned only
before pullets were loaded (RR=2, CI 95%=0.7, 5.3; p=0.2)
(Table 3).
