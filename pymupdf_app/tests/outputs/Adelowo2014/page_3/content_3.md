production farms in Ogbomoso, Ibadan and Osogbo in
Southwestern Nigeria. Four of the farms combined
swine and/or fish ponds with poultry operations. The
farms with aquaculture operations use the wastes
generated from the poultry pens as feed supplement in
the ponds. Our primary aim is to assess the potential of
the poultry production environment in Nigeria as a
reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes that can be
mobilized into human populations.


**Methodology**
_Bacterial strains_

Thirty six _E. coli_ isolated from samples of faecal
materials, litter, farm soil, water and fish pond
sediment collected from the study farms in May and
June 2008 were included in the study. The water
samples were collected as previously described [18]
while samples of soil; litter and faecal materials were
collected in sterile polythene sample bags as described

[6].The eight farms included in the study were selected
from Ogbomoso and Ibadan in Oyo State (8 [o] 0′ N 4 [o] 0′
E) and Osogbo in Osun State (7 [ o] 46′ N 4 [ o] 34′ E) of
Southwestern Nigeria. The farms are those who
voluntarily agreed to participate in the study and are
described in Table 1. Among the farms, only one has a
comprehensive record of drug usage, it was also the
only farm that admitted using enrofloxacin. The
remaining farms admitted using one or more of
furazolidone, furaltadone, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin,
neomycin, streptomycin, sulphonamides, tetracyclines,
doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin
regularly on the farms for animal health management.
The drugs are usually part of formulations used as feed
supplements, commonly referred to as “premix” which
often contained mixtures of antimicrobials. The farm
with combined aquaculture operation suspended
aquaculture operations about 5 months before the
period of sediment collection from the fish pond.

The organisms were isolated from the samples
within 24 hours on MacConkey agar as previously
described [6] and were identified at the Unit of
Antimicrobial Resistance and Molecular
Epidemiology, National Food Institute, DTU,
Copenhagen, Denmark by streaking on Blood agar,
MacConkey agar and CHROMagar orientation
Medium (Bencton Dickinson GmBH, Heigelberg,
Germany). Thirty-six non duplicated isolates
confirmed as _E. coli_ were randomly selected from the
samples and stored at -80 [o] C prior to further analysis
for Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
determination and molecular characterization.



_Susceptibility testing_

The susceptibility of the isolates to antimicrobial
agents was tested at the National Food Institute, DTU,
Denmark using commercial dehydrated Sensititre
panels (Trek Diagnostic Ltd, East Grinstead, UK)
containing the antibiotics listed below at the stated test
concentrations in mg/L. Amoxicillin (2-32 mg/L) –
clavulanate (1-16 mg/L), ampicillin (1-32 mg/L),
apramycin (4-32 mg/L), cefotaxime (0.125-4 mg/L),
ceftiofur (0.5-8 mg/L), chloramphenicol (2-64 mg/L),
ciprofloxacin (0.015-4 mg/L), colistin (1-16 mg/L),
florfenicol (2-64 mg/L), gentamicin (0.5-16 mg/L),
nalidixic acid (4-64 mg/L), neomycin (2-32 mg/L),
spectinomycin (16-256 mg/L), streptomycin (8-128
mg/L), sulphamethoxazole (64-1024 mg/L),
tetracycline (2-32 mg/L) and trimethoprim (1-32
mg/L). Panels were incubated aerobically at 37 [o] C for
18-20 hours. MIC distributions were determined
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) guidelines [19]. The MIC results were
interpreted using the European Committee for
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)
epidemiological cut-off values and _E. coli_ ATCC
25922 was used as a positive control strain.


_Molecular mechanisms of resistance_

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of
class 1 and 2 integrons and antimicrobial resistance
genes were performed as described previously [20].
One to four colonies of the tested isolates on blood
agar were suspended in 100µl of TE buffer and lysed
as previously described [20]. The lysates were used as
template in PCR to detect _strA, strB_ and _aadA_ in
streptomycin resistant isolates, _bla-TEM_ in ampicillin
resistant isolates, _sul2_ and _sul3_ in sulphamethoxazole
resistant isolates, _tet_ (A), _tet_ (B), _tet_ (C) _, tet_ (D) _, tet_ (E),
_tet_ (G) and _tet_ (39) in tetracycline resistant isolates,
_cmlA,_ _catA1_ and _floR_ (primers for _floR:_ Flor-1, 5’ATGGCAGGCGATATTCATTA-3’; flor-2: 5’AAACGGGTTGTCACGATCAT-3’) in
chloramphenicol resistant isolates, acc _(3)-IV_ in
gentamicin resistant isolates, _qnrA_, _qnrB_, _qnrC_, _qnrD,_
_qnrS_, _aac(6’)Ib_ and _qepA_ in isolates resistant to
ciprofloxacin (≥ 0.125mg/L) but sensitive to nalidxic
acid with MIC ≤ 32 mg/L [20, 22-25]. The variable
regions of Class 1 and Class 2 integrons were
amplified and representatives of the different sized
amplicons sequenced to characterise their gene
contents as described by Peirano _et al_ [21]. The
following were used as positive control strains in PCR:
_E. coli_ ( _tet_ (A)), _Salmonella Typhimurium_ DT104
( _tet_ (G)), _E. coli_ CSH50::Tn10 ( _tet_ (B)), _E. coli_
