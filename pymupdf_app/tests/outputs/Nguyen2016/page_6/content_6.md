**Discussion**
The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among _Campy-_
_lobacter_ isolates originating from chicken in Kenya were
analyzed according to the guidelines of CLSI for _Enterobac-_
_teriaceae_ which had been guided by previous reports [17,
31–34]. Clinical breakpoints for interpretation of MIC values of _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli_ from chicken are available [31,
35]. In this study a commercially available broth microdilution assay was used for the determination of MIC values for
seven antibiotics. The assay already proved to be suitable in
previous investigations [21, 27, 34, 36, 37].
In this study, only 40 out of 58 suspected _Campylobac-_
_ter_ samples could be re-cultivated. The storage conditions (temperature, microaerophilic atmosphere) using
skimmed milk medium were possibly not ideal. However,
it had been demonstrated that _C. jejuni_ can survive up to
14 days at 1 °C or 2.5 days at 20 °C in sterile skimmed milk

[38, 39]. Alternative storage of _Campylobacter_ cultures
using transport medium (for example Amies medium) or
cryovials is recommended for future investigations.
In 53 out of 58 collected samples, _Campylobacter_ DNA
was identified by mPCR assay [26]. The majority of the
cultures proved to be _C. jejuni_ (88.6 %) which is in agreement with previous studies in chicken [6, 7]. In 18 DNA
extracts of non-viable samples, 3 _C. jejuni_ (16.7 %), one
mixed population of _C. jejuni/C. coli_ and 14 _C. coli_ were
identified. These findings are in agreement with those of
a previous study that found a longer viability of _C. jejuni_
in comparison to _C. coli_ in biological milieu [40]. It may
be possible that some _C. coli_ isolates had been lost during the shipment period. In summary, _C. jejuni_ was identified much more often than _C. coli_ (64.2 %) by mPCR
investigation. In agreement with other studies, the findings highlighted the usefulness of mPCR as a reliable,



sensitive, time and cost saving method for identification
of thermophilic _Campylobacter_ [26].
The antibiotic susceptibility of 35 _Campylobacter_ isolates from Kenyan chicken was investigated using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
and epidemiological cut-off values (EUCAST–ECOFFS)

[16]. A broth microdilution assay was used as a standardized, easy, and reliable method for the determination of
MIC of seven antibiotics [17, 31–34]. High resistance rates
were obtained for ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline with more than 70 % which is in agreement with a
recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report [41].
These results are in contrast to those of Brooks et al. [5]
who reported resistance rates for _Campylobacter_ recovered from humans with diarrhoea in Western Kenya for
ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline with 6, 26 and
18 % in 2006, respectively. The general high rates of resistance in the chicken isolates may be caused by availability
and uncontrolled use of antibiotics by small farmers [42].
Resistance to chloramphenicol is remarkable with
25.8 % in this investigation. Use of chloramphenicol
is banned in animal breeding in Europe for more than
20 years, but still it is often used in many third world
countries [43]. It is easy to obtain antibiotics over-thecounter and other unregulated venues and injudicious
use promotes the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents. Resistance to gentamicin in the isolates
obtained from chicken was low in this study (25.8 %), but
_Campylobacter_ isolated from broilers and turkeys were
totally susceptible to gentamicin [37, 41, 44, 45]. Erythromycin resistance rates found in this study correspond to
those of similar studies elsewhere [41, 44, 45].
Multidrug resistance was detected in 61.3 % of the
_Campylobacter_ isolates. Eleven different combinations
were found (Table 5). Frequent, resistance to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline was identified (17 out
of 19 multidrug resistant isolates) which is in agreement
with previous investigation using Vietnamese _Campy-_
_lobacter_ isolates [45]. However, EFSA [41] reported low
level of multidrug resistance in _C. jejuni_ from broilers of
the member states of the EU.
The emerging of antibiotic resistance has been attributed to the overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents
in both the developed and developing world. Antibiotics
are widely used as growth supplements in livestock and
to prevent infections [46]. The emerging of multidrug
resistance may reflect acquisition of different resistance
determinants on the same DNA molecule or single determinants, such as multidrug pumps, that specify efflux
activity against different antimicrobial agents [47]. The
mechanisms of genetic resistance might be chromosomal
or plasmid-borne, and represent a combination of endogenous and acquired genes. In general, mechanisms of
