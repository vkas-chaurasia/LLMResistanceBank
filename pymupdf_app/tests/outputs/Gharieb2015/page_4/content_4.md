[16]. Therefore, ciprofloxacin still to have a high potency
against NTS strains in humans and continue to be the
most successful drug used for treatment of septicaemic
salmonellosis in adult humans. The increased resistance
of _S._ Typhimurium isolated from humans to quinolones
(nalidixic acid) in this study (100 %) is a matter of concern and could be attributed to indiscriminate use of
these antibiotics by human patients. Moreover, the presence of these drug residues in food of animal origin may
results in increased resistance among human’s isolates.
Table 3 verified that all _Salmonella_ spp. isolated from
poultry and humans were MDR, exhibiting resistance to
at least four or more antibiotics displayed by ten resistance patterns.


**Molecular detection of** _**Salmonella**_ **virulence genes**
**(virulotyping)**
Table 3 revealed the presence of _pef_ A gene among three
_Salmonella_ strains isolated from poultry meat, belonged
to _S._ Rubislaw, _S._ Typhimurium and untypable strain
(one isolate, each) (Fig. 1). Moreover, _hil_ A _gene_ was only
identified in one isolate of _S._ Kiel (Fig. 2). Furthermore,
three _Salmonella_ isolates from poultry meat comprising
untypable strains (two isolates) and _S._ Typhimurium (one



isolate) were harboring _sop_ B gene (Fig. 3). The detection
of _pef_ A gene in _S._ Rubislaw in Gambia and Senegal [14]
and _S._ Typhimurium in India [4] was previously reported.
On the other hand, _hil_ A gene was identified in _Salmo-_
_nella_ serotypes isolated from chickens in Iran [17].
It was obvious from Table 3 that all _S._ Typhimurium
isolates from humans were harboring _sop_ B compared to
one isolate had _stn_ gene (Figs. 3, 4). Consistent with our
findings, _sop_ B gene was previously identified in _S._ Typhimurium isolated from diarrhoeic patients and birds in
India [18]. Meanwhile, _stn_ gene was detected in _S._ Typhimurium isolated from humans in India [4].


**Molecular detection and sequencing of class 1 integrons**
A notable feature in this study is that all _Salmonella_
strains isolated from poultry meat and humans were
MDR and harboring class I integrons that are chromosomally located (Fig. 5). Ten different profiles of class I
integrons with variable amplicon sizes ranged from 650–
3000 bp were observed (Table 3). Similarily, class I integrons were detected in 97 % of _S._ Typhimurium isolated
from Norwegian diarrhoeic patients [19]. On the contrary, a lower detection rate (9 %) was recorded in _Sal-_
_monella_ spp. isolated from poultry meat [20]. Sequencing
