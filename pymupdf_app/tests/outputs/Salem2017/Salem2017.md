This study focused on 77 isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis collected during 2009 to 2013
from healthy and sick chickens and environmental farm samples in Tunisia. Resistance to 14 antimicro
bials and the encoding genes were analyzed. 66, 26, 6.5, 3.9 and 1.3% were pan-susceptible or showed

resistance to nalidixic acid (Asp87 to Tyr and Asp87 to Asn substitutions in GyrA), ampicillin (blaTEM-1-like

and blaSHV), sulfonamides (sul1and sul3) and streptomycin (strB), respectively. A single isolate with intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was positive for qnrB, whereas qnrA, qnrS or aac(6 [′] )-Ib-cr were not

detected. The virulotype of the isolates was established by testing ten virulence genes. The orgA, ssaQ,

mgtC, siiD, sopB genes, located on Salmonella pathogenicity islands, and spvC of the serotype-specific

virulence plasmid, were common to all isolates. In contrast, the prophage-associated sopE-1, sodC1 and

gipA genes and the fimbrial bcfC gene were variably represented. All isolates except one contained the

virulence plasmid, which appeared either alone or together with one or more additional plasmids. One

isolate carried a single plasmid of ca. 90 Kb which may be derived from the virulence plasmid (60 Kb).

Overall, seven resistotypes, six virulotypes and six plasmid profiles were identified. XbaI-PFGE revealed

four related pulsotypes (X1–X4), with 80% of the isolates sharing the X1 pattern. The latter isolates

exhibited different resistance, virulence and plasmid profiles, suggesting that mobile genetic elements,

particularly prophages and plasmids, are of central importance for the evolution and adaptation of S.

serotype Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis), which is mainly transmitted
through consumption of contaminated poultry meat and egg products [3], is the primary cause of human salmonellosis in many
countries, including Tunisia [4–6]. The infection develops with
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps, and is usually
self-limiting. However, S. enterica can also cause severe invasive
infections, particularly in immune-compromised hosts, the elderly
and the very young [7,8]. Antimicrobial agents are not essential
to control most Salmonella infections, but severe, life-threatening
infections require treatment. In these instances, fluoroquinolones
and broad spectrum cephalosporins are the drugs of choice [8].
Development of resistance to these key antimicrobials is hence a
major problem for public health.

Multiple factors determine the virulence of S. enterica, which
are primarily encoded by chromosomal genes, unlinked or clustered in islets (composed by a few genes) and larger pathogenicity
islands (SPIs). In Salmonella more than 20 SPIs have been detected
so far, with SPI1 to SPI5 being linked to well-defined pathogenic
processes [9]. SPI-1 and SPI-2 encode different type III secretion
systems which deliver effector proteins into the cytosol of the host
cell, leading to bacterial invasion of the intestinal epithelium as well
as proliferation of Salmonella within eukaryotic cells. SPI-3 encodes
a magnesium transporter involved in adaptation of Salmonella to
the adverse intracellular environment. SPI-4 encodes a giant nonfimbrial adhesin (SiiE) and a type I secretion system responsible for
its transport. SiiE mediates close interaction with microvilli at the
apical side of epithelial cells. SPI-5 is connected with inflammation
and chloride secretion during the enteric phase of the disease [9,10].
Other non SPI-associated genes also play an important role during
infection, for example, prophage-encoded genes and fimbrial gene
clusters [11,12]. In addition, some serotypes of S. enterica, including S. Enteritidis, harbor virulence-plasmids of variable size, which
share the spv (Salmonella plasmid virulence) locus. The spv region
seems to promote rapid growth and survival of S. enterica within the
host cells and is thus believed to play an important role in systemic

infections [13].
In Tunisia, a retrospective study on the occurrence of S. enterica during an 11-year period (1994–2004), revealed S. Enteritidis
as the most common serotype recovered from human specimens
(24.1%; 1640/6815) and animals (69%; 1551/2249), and the second
serotype found in food products (15.8%; 877/5539), only preceded
by S. Anatum. In addition, S. Enteritidis was the most common
serotype in poultry (70.3%; 1378/1959) and poultry meat (27.7%;
415/1496) [4]. A more recent study also supported the predominance of S. Enteritidis in chicken products along the 2008–2011
years [6]. Despite this, information available on the resistance and
genetic properties of isolates from chickens and environmental
farm samples in Tunisia is rather limited. The aim of the present
study was the characterization of a collection of S. Enteritidis
isolates obtained from these sources with respect to their resistance properties, virulence gene content, plasmid patterns and XbaI
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles.


**Materials** **and** **methods**


Bacterial isolates


During the period 2009–2013, we have collected 142 Salmonella
isolates, which were identified as S. Enteritidis (85; 60%), S. Eppen
dorf (22; 15.5%), S. Zanzibar (17; 12%), S. Typhimurium (7; 5%), S.
Anatum (5; 3.5%), S. Kentucky (3; 2.1%), S. Seftenberg (2; 1.3%), S.
Virchow (1; 0.7%) and S. Solt (1; 0.7%). Phenotypic and genotypic
characterization of the S. Eppendorf isolates have previously been
reported [14]. In the present study we focused on S. Enteritidis isolates owing to their high incidence. Only 77 out of the 85 originally
detected isolates could be recovered for further analysis. They were
obtained from samples (feces, organs and/or embryonic eggs) of

healthy (38) and sick chickens (8; suffering from colibacillosis or
pasteurellosis), and of the farm environment (31; waste of hatching, feathers, dust and water). The isolates were collected in 17
farms (located in central and north eastern regions of the coun
try) or during official controls along the period of four years. Initial
detection was done according to ISO method 6579/2002 and the
isolates were confirmed as Salmonella by API 20E (Bio-Mérieux,
Marcy l’Etoile, France). Serotype was determined by slide agglutination with the use of antisera (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette,

France) to identify somatic O antigens and flagellar H antigens,
according to the Kauffmann–White–Le Minor scheme [15].



Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion


Antimicrobial susceptibilities for all S. Enteritidis isolates were
tested by the disk diffusion method on Mueller–Hinton agar using
commercial disks (Oxoid, Madrid, Spain), and results were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
guidelines [16]. The following antimicrobials were used: ampicillin
10 �g (AMP), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 30 �g (AMC), cefotaxime
30 �g (CTX), cefoxitin 30 �g (FOX), apramycin 15 �g (APR), chloramphenicol 30 �g (CHL), gentamycin 10 �g (GEN), ciprofloxacin
5 �g (CIP), nalidixic acid 30 �g (NAL), streptomycin 10 �g (STR),
sulfonamides 30 �g (SUL), tetracycline 30 �g (TET), tobramycin
10 �g (TOB) and trimethoprim 5 �g (TMP). S. Enteritidis ATCC
13076 and S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 were used as control
strains.


Genes encoding antimicrobial resistance


Genes encoding resistance to ampicillin [blaOXA-1, blaPSE-1,
blaSHV, blaTEM-1-like], streptomycin [aadA1-like, aadA2, strA and strB]
and sulfonamides [sul1, sul2, sul3], selected according to the resistance phenotypes, were screened by PCR, using previously reported
primers and conditions [17]. The genetic bases of nalidixic acid
resistance were established by PCR amplification and sequencing
of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA
gene of nine isolates selected as representative of different resistance profiles [18]. Sequencing was conducted at Macrogen Europe
(Amsterdam, Netherlands). For all S. Enteritidis isolates, the qnrA,
qnrB, qnrS and aac(6 [′] )-Ib-cr genes, coding for plasmid-mediated
quinolone resistance (PMQR) were also screened by PCR [19]. To
investigate the presence of class 1 integrons in sul1- and sul3positive isolates, the presence of the int1 gene was investigated

[17].


Virulence genotyping



Plasmid profiles


Plasmid DNA was extracted by the technique of Kado and Liu

[22] and analyzed by electrophoresis on 0.6% agarose gels. Plasmids
from Escherichia coli strains 39R861 and V517 were included as size
controls.


Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis


Thirty six representative isolates with different resistance, virulence and plasmid combined profiles were typed by PFGE, using
the PulseNet protocol with the XbaI (40 U; Takara Biomedical,
Madrid, Spain) enzyme [(http://www.pulsenetinternational.org/).](http://www.pulsenetinternational.org/)
Electrophoresis was performed in a CHEF-DR III (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Madrid, Spain) with the following settings: initial switch time
2 s, final switch time 63 s, a gradient of 6 V/cm, 120 [◦] angle and 21 h
of electrophoresis. Migration of the DNA fragments was achieved
in 1% agarose gels (w/v; Ultra-Pure DNA Grade Agarose, Bio-Rad)
submerged in 0.5X TBE buffer. XbaI-digested DNA of S. Braenderup

H9812 was included as size marker. The gels were visualized under



All



S.



All S. Enteritidis isolates were tested for 10 virulence

genes, selected for their established association with Salmonella
pathogenicity [9–13]. For this, PCR amplifications were performed
using previously published primers and conditions [20,21]. Five target genes [orgA, ssaQ, mgtC, spi ~~4~~ D (siiD) and sopB] are located on
SPI1 to SPI5, one (spvC) on the virulence plasmid, three (gipA, sodC1
and sopE1) on prophages, and one (bcfC) on a fimbrial gene cluster.

(Bio-Rad).


**Results**


Amongst the 77 S. Enteritidis isolates, resistances to nalidixic
acid, ampicillin, sulfonamides and streptomycin were observed
in 20 (26%), five (6.5%), three (3.9%) and one (1.3%) isolates,
respectively. In addition, a single isolate showed intermediate
susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, but resistances to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tobramycin and trimethoprim
were not detected (Table 1). Overall, 51 isolates (66.2%) were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested while only 26 (33.8%) were
resistant to one or more compounds. The genes responsible for
the observed resistances are shown in Table 1. Sulfonamide resistance was encoded by sul1 or sul3, detected in one and two isolates,
respectively. The streptomycin-resistant isolate harbored the strB
gene but was negative for strA. The blaTEM-1-like and blaSHV genes
were found in four and one of the ampicillin resistant isolates,
respectively. The gene intI1, encoding the integrase of class 1 integrons, was not detected in the sul1- or sul3-positive S. Enteritidis

isolates. Two mutations in the gyrA gene, changing Asp87 (GAC) to
Tyr (TAC) and Asp87 (GAC) to Asn (AAC) were identified as responsible for nalidixic acid resistance in three and two of the isolates
tested, respectively. In four other cases, mutations in the QRDR of
gyrA were not detected; thus further research will be needed to
establish the genetic basis of their resistance. With regard to PMQR
genes, qnrB was present in the single isolate with intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (1.3%), while qnrA, qnrS and aac(6 [′] )-Ib-cr
genes were not observed. By combining resistant-phenotypes and
genes involved, a total of seven profiles (R1 to R7) were identified
(Table 1).
The presence or absence of ten virulence genes was investigated
in the panel of 77 S. Enteritidis isolates by PCR amplification with
specific primer pairs (Table 1). The orgA, ssaQ, mgtC, siiD (spi4 D)
and sopB, selected as markers of SPI1 to SPI5, and the spvC used as
indicator of the virulence plasmid of S. Enteritidis, were found in all
isolates. The prophage-associated sopE1, gipA and sodC genes were
detected in 75 (97.4%), 74 (96.1%) and 37 (48%) isolates, respectively. The bcfC fimbrial gene was present in 75 (97.4%) isolates.
Overall, we observed six distinct virulence profiles (V). The V1 profile that included all tested genes was found in 34 (44.1%) isolates;
the V2 profile lacking the sodC1 gene was found in 36 (46.8%) isolates; the V3, V4 and V5 profiles lacking bcfC, sopE plus sodC1 and
sodC1 plus gipA, respectively, were each shown by two isolates; and
the V6 profile lacking gipA was represented by a single isolate.
Six plasmid patterns (P1–P6) were found in the present study
(Fig. 1A; Table 1). All except one isolate harbored a plasmid of ca.
60 Kb, which is the size expected for the virulence plasmid of S.
Enteritidis. This plasmid appeared either alone (67 isolates; 87%; P1
profile) or together with one or more additional plasmids ranging
in size from ca. 2 Kb up to 80 Kb (profiles P2–P5, with two, five,
one and one isolates, respectively). The remaining isolate carried a
single plasmid of ca. 90 Kb (profile P6).
Altogether, 19 combinations of resistance, virulence and
plasmid profiles were identified (Table 1). The most frequent combination (35.1%) corresponded to susceptible isolates (R0), carrying
all virulence genes tested (V1) and containing the virulence plasmid
alone (P1). Isolates positive for the virulence plasmid, lacking sodC1
and being either susceptible (23.4%) or resistant to nalidixic acid
(15.6%) were also very common. The genetic relatedness of 36 isolates covering different combinations of resistance, virulence and
plasmid profiles, were investigated by PFGE. Four closely related
pulsotypes, named X1–X4, were found (Fig. 1B; Table 1). The major

pulsotype was X1 that encompassed 29 isolates, while X2, X3 and



X4 included only one, two and four isolates, respectively. X1 was
associated with isolates of different origin (healthy and sick chickens as well as environmental samples) and with diverse resistance,
virulence and plasmid profiles.


**Discussion**


In this study, 77 S. Enteritidis isolates recovered in Tunisia from
chicken facilities (healthy and sick animals as well as the farm
environment) during a period of five years were examined for
antimicrobial susceptibility and the genetic basis of the observed
resistances. More than half of the isolates were susceptible to
all antimicrobials tested, which is consistent with other studies
indicating that antimicrobial drug resistance is uncommon in S.
Enteritidis [23–25]. In the present study, a low incidence of streptomycin, ampicillin and sulfonamides resistance (1.3%, 3.9% and 6.5%,
respectively), and a relatively high level of nalidixic acid resistance
(26%) were observed. The spread of sulfonamides resistance in
Enterobacteriaceae including S. enterica is largely due to the frequent
location of sul1 and sul3 genes in class 1 integrons, which often contain gene cassettes encoding resistance also to other antimicrobials.

Although these genes were identified as responsible for sulfonamides resistance in the S. Enteritidis isolates from Tunisia, neither
intI1 nor any gene cassette characteristically associated with class
1 integrons, were detected [26]. However, the presence of defective
class 1 integrons cannot be ruled out.
Resistance to quinolones has increasingly been reported in
Enterobacteriaceae from animal and human origin worldwide. Particularly, poultry-derived S. Enteritidis isolates have been shown to
be highly resistant to nalidixic acid, probably due to the widespread
use of quinolones in poultry production systems [27]. Antimicrobial agents used to be widely administered in animal husbandry
for growth promotion, a practice now banned in many countries,
but still common in others. In Tunisia it was banned since 1999,
although the law is not enforced. Unfortunately, official documents
about the use of antimicrobials in Tunisian avian husbandry are
not available. However, according to veterinarians and farmers,
florfenicol (fenicol), ofloxacin (second generation fluoroquinolone)
and doxycycline (tetracycline) are commonly administered in avian
farms to treat some infections, specifically chronic respiratory diseases, colibacillosis or necrotic enteritis. These antimicrobials are
sometimes excessively applied with a concurrent lack of bacteriological analysis. Thus, a better control of antimicrobial usage in
chicken production systems in Tunisia is required.
Quinolone resistance is usually associated with alterations in the
gyrA gene which encodes the A subunit of the target DNA gyrase.
In fact, Asp87 to Tyr or Asp87 to Asn mutations were found in the
gyrA genes of five isolates tested, these being the most common
mutations associated with nalidixic acid resistance in S. Enteritidis [23,28,29]. A single isolate carried the qnrB gene, but none
of the isolates was positive for qnrA, qnrS and aac(6 [′] )-Ib-cr genes.
This is consistent with a low-level rate of dissemination of PMQR
among chicken-associated isolates of S. Enteritidis in Tunisia. In
fact, PMQR genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and aac(6 [′] )-Ib-cr) have been
previously reported in only five out of 113 nalidixic acid resistant isolates of this serotype (4.4%) recovered from different food
sources, but mainly from chicken, during the 2008–2011 period
in Tunisia [6]. The frequency of nalidixic acid resistance reported
in the latter study (31.4%) was close to the value obtained for the
2009–2013 period reported herein (26%).
The 77 S. Enteritidis isolates were further characterized according to virulotype and plasmid content, which resulted in six profiles
each. Nearly half of the isolates (44%) shared the same virulotype
(V1), which included all virulence genes tested. These genes were

selected as markers of regions known to be highly conserved (SPIs

and virulence plasmid) or variable (prophages and fimbrial operons) in S. Enteritidis. It is well known that prophages play a key
role in the evolution of pathogenic bacteria such as S. enterica [11],
leading to genotypic and phenotypic diversity even between isolates of the same serotype. Fimbriae also contribute to bacterial
diversity and are considered to be important for host adaptation.
Accordingly, all isolates tested here were positive for targets located
on SPIs and for spvC, while the observed variations were related
to the gipA, sodC1 and sopE1 genes, carried by prophages Gifsy-1,
Gifsy-2 and a cryptic �-like phage in S. Enteritidis, as well as to
the bcfC fimbrial gene [11,12,30]. The least frequent virulence target was sodC1, found in less than half of the isolates, while the
frequency of all other variable genes was ≥95%. The gene sodC1
encodes a periplasmic Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase that promotes
survival of S. Typhimurium in macrophages [31]. In contrast to
the present study, high and low frequencies were respectively
reported for sodC1 and gipA in S. Enteritidis isolates from different sources (human, poultry and food) in nine European countries

[21,32]. This raises the interesting possibility of geographical variations between Europe and North Africa, but similar variations have
not been observed within Europe [21].
As mentioned above, the spvC gene was detected in all isolates analyzed in the present study, although S. Enteritidis isolates
lacking the virulence plasmid have occasionally been reported

[20,21,23,33]. It should be noted that all except one of the isolates carried a 60 Kb plasmid, which is the size expected for the
virulence plasmid. The remaining isolate contained a ca. 90 Kb
plasmid which may have originated from the smaller version,



as the isolate was positive for spvC. In fact, larger derivatives of
the virulence plasmid, most carrying multiple resistance genes,
have previously been reported in clinical isolates of S. Enteritidis

[20,34,35]. However, the Tunisian isolate harboring the 90 Kb plasmid was pan-susceptible, so the role of the DNA which was possibly
acquired remains unknown. In S. Enteritidis, plasmids of different
sizes (ca. 7, 40, 90 and 100 Kb) have been implicated in the spread
of the blaTEM-1 gene for ampicillin resistance [23,36]. In this study,
all ampicillin resistant isolates carried a 40 Kb plasmid where the
blaTEM-1 gene could be located. Similarly, PMQR genes have been
found on plasmids of variable size and incompatibility groups, indicating that multiple plasmids are responsible for the worldwide
spread of these genes [37]. Together with 60 Kb and 40 Kb plasmids, several small plasmids, ranging in size from 2 to 6 Kb, were
detected in the single qnrB-positive isolate identified in this study,
which was additionally resistant to ampicillin.
XbaI-PFGE analysis conducted for representative isolates identified four closely or possibly related pulsotypes, according to the
criteria of Tenover et al. [38], with a clear predominance of one of
them (X1). This pulsotype was previously associated with human
isolates recovered from diarrheagenic stool samples in Tunisia, as
well as from feces and other clinical samples in different countries

[5,20,39]. Interestingly, X1 isolates exhibited different resistance,
virulence and plasmid patterns, suggesting that mobile genetic elements, particularly prophages and plasmids, are playing an active
role in the evolution of S. Enteritidis circulating in chicken farms in
Tunisia.
