of isolates) (12). This trend was also noted by Mrema et al. (17), who found that 9.7% of sausage isolates were resistant to tetracycline. However, 100% resistance was found for sulfafurazole. Tetracycline and sulfafurazole were not included in the panel of antibiotics in the present study, so resistance to these two antibiotics could not be tracked. However, all isolates were sensitive to tigecycline, a new-generation derivative of tetracycline, and to the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination. Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic similar to sulfafurazole, both of which have a broader spectrum of activity than the generic formulations. These data indicate a shift in resistant patterns; Salmonella isolates found in the present study were predominantly resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Nevertheless, all isolates from this study were susceptible to carbapenems.

Because Salmonella Muenchen can cause transient infections (3) and Salmonella Typhimurium is an established pathogen, the presence of multidrug resistance in these pathogens presents a health care challenge. Salmonella Enteritidis, which also was isolated, was resistant to a seven antimicrobial drugs tested. Although antibiotics are not routinely given to individuals with Salmonella infections, antibiotics are prescribed to immunocompromised patients and patients with systemic infections. The results of the present study indicate that consumers of meat sausages are at risk for being infected by multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains. The information on the prevalence and the correlation between the serotype and antimicrobial resistance can be useful for identifying trends and assessing the effectiveness of current initiatives within the food industry to improve food hygiene strategies aimed at reducing bacterial loads in primary production and at the various stages of the food production chain.
