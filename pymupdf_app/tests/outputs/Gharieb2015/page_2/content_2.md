**Background**
Non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ (NTS) is one of the major
zoonotic food-borne pathogens representing an important public health problem worldwide. It can cause a
variety of clinical manifestations ranging from mild gastroenteritis to bacteraemia and extra intestinal localized
infections involving many organs. The global burden of
NTS gastroenteritis has been estimated to be 93.8 million cases of gastroenteritis each year with 155, 000
deaths annually [1]. Food of animal origin especially
poultry meat is considered to be one of the major vehicles of _Salmonella_ infections in humans and has been
implicated in outbreaks of human salmonellosis [2].
Antimicrobial resistance and virulence of _Salmonella_
strains play a vital role in systemic infections. _Salmonella_
pathogenicity is dictated by an array of factors encoded
by virulence genes that assist the organism to express
its virulence in the host cells and ultimately manifest in
the typical symptoms of salmonellosis. Some genes are
known to be involved in adhesion and invasion including; plasmid encoded fimbriae ( _pefA_ ) and hyper invasive
locus ( _hilA_ ) [3, 4]. _Salmonella_ outer proteins (sop A-E)
encoded by _sop_ gene and ( _stn_ ) codes for enterotoxin productions are associated with the actual manifestation of
pathogenic processes [5]. In addition to virulence factors, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among
NTS has become a public health threat. Since food of
animal origin is a major source of _Salmonella_ spp., it
has been suggested that abundant use of antimicrobials
in food animals’ production may contribute to the presence of antimicrobial resistance in these species and subsequently transferred to humans through food chain [6].
Factors contributed to the resistance and virulence of
_Salmonella_ may be located on chromosomes, plasmids,
transposon and integrons. Integrons are DNA elements
that can transfer antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria. Class I integrons are the most common type of
integrons recognized among the multidrug resistant



(MDR) _Salmonella_ and have conserved regions (5′-CS
and 3′-CS) which often contain gene cassettes [7]. These
cassettes contain genes that confer resistance to antimicrobial agents including aminoglycosides, b-lactams,
chloramphenicol and trimethoprim as well as genes that
confer resistance to antiseptics and disinfectants [8]. The
present study was undertaken to (i) trace the prevalence
and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of NTS _enter-_
_ica_ serotypes isolated from poultry meat and diarrhoeic
patients (ii) ascertain the presence of virulence genes
and class I integrons using PCR (iii) sequencing of the
amplified DNA fragments of class I integrons in order
to identify the resistance genes located in integron gene
cassettes.


**Results and discussion**
**Prevalence of** _**Salmonella**_ **serovars in poultry meat**
**and diarrhoeic patients**
In the present study, the overall prevalence of _Salmonella_
spp. in the total examined poultry meat samples was
10 % (Table 1). This result was compatible with previous
studies in Nepal [9]. Moreover, our results regarding the
prevalence of _Salmonella_ spp. in broiler chicken meat
(14 %) substantiate the findings of others in Canada [10].
Serotyping of _Salmonella_ spp. isolated from poultry
meat in this study revealed the predominance of _S._ Typhimurium in chicken meat and this was in concordance
with previous studies from India [11]. Additionally, other
serovars such as _S._ Rubislaw, _S._ Kiel (chicken meat) and _S._
Derby (duck meat) were identified.
It was obvious from Table 1 that 4 % (2 out of 50) of
stool samples from diarrhoeic patients were positive
for _Salmonella_ spp. and _S._ Typhimurium was the only
serotype identified. Nearly similar prevalence in diarrhoeic patients was reported in India [12]. The isolation
of _S._ Derby from poultry meat and humans has been
previously recorded in Netherlands [13]. Moreover, _S._
Rubislaw was isolated from chicken meat in Senegal and
