**FIG 1** Proportion of resistance-transducing phages among all isolated phages.
Kanamycin resistance-transducing phages were detected the most often ( _n_ 43 of 243 phages detected), followed by chloramphenicol ( _n_ - 8) and tetracycline ( _n_ - 4) resistance-transducing phages. Three phages were found to transduce kanamycin plus ampicillin resistance, and two phages transduced kanamycin plus chloramphenicol resistance. �Cm [r], �Km [r], �Tet [r], �Km [r] Amp [r],

resistance only were isolated from seven chicken meat samples.
Phagestransducingkanamycinandchloramphenicolresistancewere
found in six samples. Phages from three samples could transduce
either kanamycin or ampicillin resistance. Chloramphenicol resistance-transducingphageswererecoveredfromthreesamples.Phages
with the ability to transduce resistance to tetracycline only were seen
in another two samples, and kanamycin and tetracycline resistancetransducing phages were isolated from one sample.
**Antimicrobial resistance transduced by phages.** Kanamycin
resistance could be transduced the most often, i.e., by 43
phages. Eight phages were able to transduce chloramphenicol
resistance, and four transduced tetracycline resistance. Three
phages could transduce ampicillin and kanamycin resistance,

and two transduced chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance (Fig. 1). No phages were able to transduce extendedspectrum �-lactamase production to _E. coli_ ATCC 13706.
**Coliphage characterization.** An optimized titer was defined
by titration of phages ( _n_ - 243) isolated from chicken meat. The
titer of each phage was calculated to range from 1.5 � 10 [8] to 3.1 �
10 [10] PFU/ml. For a brief characterization of the antimicrobial resistance-transducing phages, a lysotype pattern was determined
for five different _E. coli_ strains (ATCC 13706, JM109, W3110,
MC1061, and DH5�) using lysates of each phage whose titers had
been determined. Table 3 lists the different lysotypes of all antimicrobial resistance-transducing phages. A high degree of variability, given by 13 different lysotypes, was seen within these phages
isolated from chicken meat.
**Detection of resistance genes in transduced** _**E. coli**_ **isolates.**
The _tet_ (A) gene fragment could be amplified from all transduced
tetracycline-resistant _E. coli_ isolates. All transduced kanamycinresistant _E. coli_ isolates harbored the _aphA1_ gene. All but one _E. coli_
isolate to which ampicillin resistance was transduced harbored the
_bla_ TEM gene. The _floR_ gene was detected in three transduced chloramphenicol-resistant _E. coli_ isolates. Southern blot analysis of five
kanamycin-resistant isolates of _E. coli_ ATCC 13706 transduced
with phage ��5c uncovered that the _aphA1_ gene integrated at
different sites in the genome; thus, homologous recombination
was not required.
**Association of resistance-transducing phages and** _**E. coli**_ **in**
**meat samples.** A statistically significant association between the
presence/absence of resistant _E. coli_ isolates and the presence/
absence of phages able to transduce the same antimicrobial
resistance into _E. coli_ ATCC 13706 in chicken meat samples was
established for kanamycin ( _P_ - 0.01) (Table 4).
