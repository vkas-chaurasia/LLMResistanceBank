Osman et al. ARGs with Staphylococci Chicken Meat



which indicated that the incidence of MRSA was infrequent in
poultry meat when compared to the beef and pork meats and with
variable prevalences between regions.
Antibiotic resistance patterns of individual pathogens to the
drugs used to treat them vary considerably between and within
countries. The discrepancies and uncomparable results between
researchers, including us, was incriminated by Kluytmans et al.
(1995), Chaibenjawong and Foster (2011), Doyle et al. (2011) and
Omurtag et al. (2013) to be due to several criteria, such as: (i)
sampling and culture methods differed among the studies; (ii)
the condition of the meat when being sold is it packed or unpacked in the supermarkets or through the widely spread butcher
shops in Great Cairo; (iii) MRSA carriers can contaminate
meat during slaughter and processing; (iv) pathogen load on
raw meat changes according to species; (v) heat treatment and
cross-contamination change the pathogen titre on the meat; (vi)
serving frequency and size, and demographic data; (vii) regional
differences and social groups dissimilarities are conditions that
must be taken into consideration; (viii) infected/colonized food
handlers are favorable causes for meat contamination (ix)
under conditions of temperature abuse, MSSA and MRSA
cells could multiply on meat; (ix) the unjuridical use of
antibiotics for animals; (x) different patterns of antibiotic use;
(xi) distinct national disease burdens; (xii) disparities in access
to first—and second-line treatments; and (xiii) the burden of
coinfections.
Eventually, AMR drugs have become a global public health
crisis implicating the importance of preventing contamination of
food with MRSA, which could have trade consequences and exert
coercion to those sovereignties with un-controlled antimicrobial
practices to create and enforce proper danger administration
strategies. Therefore, the use of antibiotics for animals and their
documentation has become a must to aid in analyzing their use
and consequent impact on public health to enact policy changes
on the consumption of antibiotics (APUA, 2010b; WHO, 2013).

CONCLUSION


The occurrence of CNS in food should not be ignored nor their
pathogenic potential considered as insignificant as a food-borne
pathogen, rather safety measures should be taken to reduce or
totally eliminate their occurrence in foods. The incidence of CNS
may render food unsafe, as the clinical isolates have been reported
to exude virulent traits (Fowoyo and Ogunbanwo, 2016). Our
findings emphasize the need for improved hygiene practices
during food processing and also during the distribution and
consumption of the final food products to avoid the presence
of CNS and CPS isolates in meat. The present study cynosures
that the MRS has entered the food chain in Egypt through the
raw chicken meat constituting a health hazard to consumers and
should be given importance due to their zoonotic importance.
This necessitates the urgent implementation of an energetic
policy to ensure microbiological food safety to prevent the
spread of MRS through the food chain by contamination of raw
meat. In addition, these isolates might indicate the promulgation
of methicillin, oxacillin, and vancomycin resistance in the
community and imply food safety hazards.
