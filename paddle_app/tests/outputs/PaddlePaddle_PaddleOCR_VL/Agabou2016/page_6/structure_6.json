[27] suggested that the potential transmission of multidrug-resistant E. coli clones from poultry to humans seems to involve phylogroups A and B1 rather than B2 and D. Phylogroups A and B1 are known to be broad host-spectrum and could be found in all vertebrate hosts, whereas B2 and D are narrow host-spectrum and largely restricted to endothermic vertebrates, with B2 isolates as the most host-adapted [28]. In the adaptation process, mutation is the main driving evolutionary course in the E. coli group A, whereas recombination is more prevalent in B1, B2, and D [29]. Phylogroups A, B1, and D are more likely to have derived from the ancestral E. coli lineages [30, 31], and the minor genetic differences observed between strains from the different source groups could be related to their further evolutionary changes associated with host specificity [32]. This is another explanation of our results, as we found clonal human and avian strains belonging mainly to phylogroups B1 and D.",

This is an important finding, since the ST131 clone has been previously isolated from clinical cases and the environment in Algeria [33, 34]. In contrast, a 90.9 % similarity was found between avian and human O25b:H4-ST131  $ ibeA-bla_{CTX-M-9}^{+} $ strains in Spain [35]. According to Giufère et al. [36] and Cortès et al. [37], ST131 clone is strongly predominant in human ciprofloxacin-resistant  $ E.\\ coli $  strains, but less in avian ones in which it has not necessary to produce an ESBL, and the acquisition of these enzyme-encoding plasmids was probably achieved in a later stage of its evolution [35, 38, 39]. The fact that a big number of our ExPEC isolates belong to clusters exclusive to humans suggests that most of human pathogenic strains may not be derived from extra-human (avian) ones. However, the clonality among several avian and human isolates supports the idea of their evolution from a recent common ancestor.",
