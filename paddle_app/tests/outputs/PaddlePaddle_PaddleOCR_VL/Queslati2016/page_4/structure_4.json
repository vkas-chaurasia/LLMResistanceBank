Kentucky) was positive for h-li gene (Table 1, Figs. 2 and 3). Our results were similar to those of Karraouan et al. (2010) who indicated that all strains  $ (n = 39) $  of Salmonella were positive for the invasion gene invA. Several serotypes (Muenster, Newport, Corvallis, Albert, Bredeney, Hadar, Derby, Kiel, Altona and Infantis) were negative for both virulence genes spvC and h-li, while 4/8 of S. Kentucky serotype were positive for the gene h-li. Only S. Gallinarum was positive.",
