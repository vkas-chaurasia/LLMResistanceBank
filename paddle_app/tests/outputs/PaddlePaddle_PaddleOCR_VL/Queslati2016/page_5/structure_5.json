In addition, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. was higher in summer and in cattle with digestive disorders. Six serotypes of Salmonella were identified; S. Montevideo was the most frequent, followed by S. Anatum, S. Minnesota, S. Amsterdam, S. Kentucky and S. Brandenburg. Unlike other serotypes, S. Montevideo was present during the whole year except winter. All Salmonella strains were positive for invasion gene invA and negative for spvC virulence gene. Only one (S. Kentucky) was positive for h-li gene. Almost all of the strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella concerned many serotypes, including Amoxicillin, Tetracycline, Streptomycin and Nalidixic acid. S. Kentucky was the most resistant serotype. The association of multidrug-resistance and invasion gene in Salmonella isolates justifies the need of surveillance system for both human and animal health sectors.",
