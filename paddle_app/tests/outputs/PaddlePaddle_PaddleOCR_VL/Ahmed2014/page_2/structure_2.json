In developed countries, many surveys have been conducted at the molecular level to monitor the incidence of MDR Salmonella enterica in meat and dairy products (Ahmed et al., 2009a; Barlow and Gobius, 2006; Clemente et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Mohamed et al., 2014; Thong and Modarressi, 2011; Van Keesel et al., 2013; Wong and Chen, 2013; Zhao et al., 2009). However, the extent of antibiotic resistance to S. enterica in many developing countries and the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain unclear. The misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals in these countries is not uncommon. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a large scale survey to determine the incidence of MDR strains of S. enterica isolated from meat and dairy products in Egypt and to characterize the molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance.",

Food is generally considered to be the most important vector for the spread of resistance between humans and animals (WHO, 2007). In this study 47 out of 69 isolates (68.1%) showed multidrug resistance phenotypes to at least three classes of antimicrobials (Table 1). The incidence of MDR isolates was higher in meat products (69.8%) than in dairy products (62.5%). The MDR S. enterica serovars were: S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (34.8%), S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (21.8%), S. enterica serovar Infantis (10.1%) and S. enterica non-typable serovar (1.4%) (Table 1). The highest resistance was to ampicillin (95.7%), then to kanamycin (93.6%), spectinomycin (93.6%), streptomycin (91.5%) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (91.5%) (Table 1). Interestingly, the results of multidrug resistance phenotypes in this study are quite similar to that we previously reported in S. enterica isolated from diarrheic calves in Egypt as 66.7% of S. enterica showed multidrug resistance phenotypes to ampicillin, amoxicillin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and kanamycin (Ahmed et al., 2009b). Our results confirm the high level of resistance to the traditional antibiotics used widely in Egypt. Unfortunately, in developing countries, these antibiotics are widely used to treat diarrhea because of their low cost and availability (Van et al., 2012).",
