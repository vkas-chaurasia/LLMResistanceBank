## Abstract

Introduction: This study investigated the mechanisms of resistance in 36 E. coli isolated from waste, litter, soil and water samples collected from poultry farms in Southwestern Nigeria.

Methodology: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions of the isolates were determined using the methods of the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute and resistance genes detected by PCR.

Results: A total of 30 isolates (94%) showed resistance to more than one antimicrobial. Percentage resistance was: tetracycline 81%, sulphamethoxazole 67%, streptomycin 56%, trimethoprim 47%, ciprofloxacin 42%, ampicillin 36%, spectinomycin 28%, nalidixic acid 25%, chloramphenicol 22%, neomycin 14%, gentamicin 8%, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftiofuro, ceftoxime, colistin, florfenicol and apramycin 0%. Resistance genes found among the isolates include bla-TEM (85%), sul2 (67%), sul3 (17%), aadA (65%), strA (70%), strB (61%), catA1 (25%), cmlAI (13%), tetA (21%) and tetB (17%). Class 1 and 2 integrons were found in five (14%) and six (17%) isolates, respectively, while one isolate was positive for both classes of integrons. Seven out of eight isolates with resistance to ciprofloxacin and MIC  $ \leq $  32 mg/L to nalidixic acid contained qnrS genes.

Conclusions: Our findings provided additional evidence that the poultry production environment in Nigeria represents an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes such as qnrS that may spread from livestock production farms to human populations via manure and water.

Key words: Farm waste; livestock production environment; qnrS.

## I ntroduction

Antimicrobial drug use in livestock production has been implicated as a risk factor in the development and dissemination of drug resistance from livestock production farms  $ [1,2] $ . Food animals and their production environments are reservoirs of both resistant bacteria and resistance genes that could be transferred to humans either by direct contact between animals and humans or indirectly via the food production chain  $ [3,4] $ ; or as a result of the spread of animal waste on land  $ [5,2] $ . In Nigeria, antimicrobial agents are routinely used in livestock production especially as additives to feed and water  $ [6] $ . This may result in a selective advantage and a consequent increase in the abundance of resistant bacteria in animals, their wastes and surrounding environment  $ [5] $ . Antibiotic resistant bacteria have been detected in poultry waste  $ [7,8,6,9] $ , commercial poultry production environments  $ [10,11] $  and poultry products  $ [12,13] $ .



Most food animal production farms in Nigeria have no waste treatment facility. Wastes generated on these farms are either dumped in heaps on farmlands or at remote locations, often inside or close to water bodies. Wastes are also used as organic fertilizer or as feed supplements, especially in fish ponds. This raises the fear that human beings resident in the vicinity of the farm and/or animal waste dump may be exposed to antibiotic resistant bacteria in the waste. In addition, close interaction between human and animal ecosystems is a common occurrence in Nigeria with livestock kept in close proximity to or inside human residences. This practice has been shown to favour high rates of transmission of zoonotic E. coli between livestock and humans in rural Uganda [14]. Although E. coli is a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract of
