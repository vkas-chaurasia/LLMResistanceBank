the inhibition zones were measured with calipers. _Escherichia_
_coli_ ATCC 25922 and _Staphylococcus aureus_ ATCC 25923
were used as reference strains. The isolates were classified
as sensitive, intermediate, and resistant according to the
guidelines prepared by CLSI [35].


**3. Results**


_3.1. Prevalence._ Overall, 119 chickens ceaca were purchased from one commercial slaughter and cultured for
thermophilic _Campylobacters._ From these 119 samples, 76
(63,8%) were positives and 43 (36.2%) were negatives to
_Campylobacter_ tests. Among the _Campylobacter_ positives,
51.3% were _Campylobacter jejuni_ and 48.7% were _Campy-_
_lobacter coli_ .


_3.2. Antimicrobial Susceptibility._ The results of antimicrobial
susceptibility testing for _Campylobacter_ spp. isolated from
chickens to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin are presented in Table 1.
For all isolates, antimicrobial resistance to nalidixic
acid and ciprofloxacin was observed in 78.9% and 50%,
respectively.
Among the 39 isolates of _C. jejuni_ 79.5% ; 38.5% ;
17.9%; 7.7% were resistant to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin,
amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin, respectively.
Among the 37 isolates, 78.4%; 43.2%; 13.5%; 8.1% were
resistant to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and
erythromycin, respectively. In this study all isolates of _C. coli_
were sensitive to gentamicin.


**4. Discussion**


Case-control studies of foodborne infection rates have
estimated that 50 to 70% of _Campylobacter_ illness is due to
consumption of contaminated poultry and their products

[9, 17, 36]. Several studies examined thermophilic _Campy-_
_lobacter_ in poultry, and the findings indicated prevalence



ranges of the bacteria from 3% to 98% with _C. jejuni_ or _C._
_coli_ as the main isolates [36, 37].
Poultry and their products are commonly consumed
in modern Ivoirians diets, but campylobacteriosis is not
reported in Cˆote d’Ivoire up to now. Therefore, the primarily
objective of this study was to determine prevalence of
thermophilic species including _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli,_ in
poultry in Abidjan.
This work demonstrated high prevalence of thermophilic
_Campylobacter_ in the studied chickens (63.8%). This proportion is similar to the results obtained in previous study
(66.6%) [28]. Among the _Campylobacter_ isolates 51.3% were
_C. jejuni_ and 48.7% were _C. coli_ .
Such a high isolation rate of thermophilic _Campylobacter_
in chickens has also been reported [37–42]. However,
prevalence of _C. coli_ in chicken is higher in this study than
others findings [39, 42].
Poor hygiene and sanitation in poultry farms in Cˆote
d’Ivoire could explain this high level of prevalence of _C. coli_ .
Indeed, most farms do not have security fence to prevent
penetration of other animals including pigs, which are good
carriers of _C. coli_ . In some cases flocks of sheep or cattle and
poultry take place at the same sites contributing like that to
the contamination of chicken flocks with _C. coli_ .
Antibiogram test indicated higher resistance of the
microorganisms to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid. Recent
studies reported that fluoroquinolone-resistant _Campylobac-_
_ter_ spp. rapidly emerged among poultry flocks [19, 24, 43,
44].
Alfredson and Korolik [45] advanced an hypothesis
to explain this observation. They suggested that the use
of enrofloxacin (derivates close to the fluoroquinolones
used in human medicine) in animals flocks has probably
exerted a selection pressure in animal reservoirs [22]. The
absence of fluoroquinolone resistance of _Campylobacter_ in
Australia, country that has never used enrofloxacin, is a
strong argument in favor of this hypothesis.
