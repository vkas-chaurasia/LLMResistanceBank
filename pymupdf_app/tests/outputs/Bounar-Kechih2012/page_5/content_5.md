et al. (2009) but refuted by those of Uyttendaele et
al. (1998) in Belgium and Foley et al. (2008) in the
USA, who have ranked it among the 6 most common
serotypes. The study of the distribution of _Salmonella_
serotypes within 4 wilayas taught us about their dynamic expansion across the adjacent wilayas, or even
their possible spread in the national territory. Bouira
was the wilaya that counted most of the serotypes, with
a high prevalence of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, _Salmonella_
Heidelberg, and _Salmonella_ Typhimurium. Bejaïa had
less diversity than that recorded in Bouira; the predominant serotypes were _Salmonella_ Albany, _Salmo-_
_nella_ Heidelberg, and _Salmonella_ Infantis. Although
Tizi-Ouzou and Boumerdes had only 15 and 16 strains,
diversity was observed with a predominance of _Salmo-_
_nella_ Albany and _Salmonella_ Heidelberg, respectively.
The homogeneous distribution of all serotypes in the
study’s area could be the consequence of the uncontrolled movement of poultry products.


_**Resistance of Antimicrobial Agents Tested**_

There is a positive correlation between antimicrobial
use and bacterial resistance rates; indeed, each expo


sure eliminates the susceptible bacteria and promotes
the growth of resistant strains (Jaecklin, 2002; Fluit,
2005). Even though the treatment of avian salmonellosis is banned in Algeria by ministerial order (JORA,
2003), the high rate of antimicrobial resistance that we
recorded (53%) could be explained by the indiscriminate use of these drugs for therapeutic, prophylactic
purposes or as growth promoters. Our result was significantly higher than that reported by Al-Bahry et al.
(2007; 23.7%) and lower than that recorded by Elgroud
et al. (2008; 80%) and that reported by the PICRA
(2006; 63%). Multidrug resistance observed in our study
was also described by Bornert (2000) and Al-Bahry et
al. (2007). Moreover, resistance was found for 6 of the
9 antimicrobial classes tested. The observed resistance
to first generation quinolones (nalidixic acid) was the
most frequent. This is likely due to their repeated use in
poultry production. Fortunately, there is no resistance
to fluoroquinolones tested (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin,
levofloxacin) as reported by Mc Kenzie and Nadeau
(2006). These results corroborate several international
studies (Heurtin-Le Corre et al. 1999; San Martin et al.,
2005; PICRA, 2006). _Salmonella_ isolates were found to
be resistant to ciprofloxacin in previous French (Brisabois et al., 1997) and Algerian studies (Elgroud et al.,
2009; Bouzidi et al., 2011), which is more worrying as
fluoroquinolones should be reserved for the treatment
of invasive human salmonellosis (Davies et al., 1999).
Although furans have been removed from the Algerian
nomenclature, we recorded a high rate of resistance to
nitrofurantoїnes. This result was lower than that noted in 2004 in Poland by Wasyl and Hoszowski (2004;
48.2%). The rates of resistance to cyclines reported by
several authors were higher than those we recorded and
ranged from 20 to 91% (Brisabois et al., 1997; Dinh
Nam Lâm et al., 2000; Mc Kenzie and Nadeau, 2006;
PICRA, 2006). As for sulphonamides, our result was
higher than that reported by the national monitoring network to antimicrobial resistance (7%; Aboun,
2005) and lower than that noted by Brisabois et al.
