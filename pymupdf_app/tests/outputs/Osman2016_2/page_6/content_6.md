Zone diameter values. The results of the interpretation are indicated in brackets (R, Resistant). For disk zone diameter interpretation (CLSI, 2014) standards was used, (n=): number of
isolates.



The PCR amplification results are summarized in **Table 5** . All
except for one staphylococcal isolate (S. lentus) beared > two
antibiotic resistant genes and a noticeable number of these
staphylococci (17/27, 63.7%) carried four different antibiotic
resistant genes. In particular, the nine S. aureus isolates carried
the five antibiotic resistant genes that confer resistance to
the 12 different antibiotics tested in this investigation. Seven
S. aureus, six S. hyicus, four S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, three
S. intermedius and one S. lentus isolates although being resistant
to oxacillin yet, 11/27 (40.7%) carried the mecA gene. The
association between the mecA gene and oxacillin resistance is
outlined in **Table 5** . At the same time, the cfr gene was present
in 2 of the nine S. aureus isolates, and totally undetectable
in S. hyicus, S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, S. intermedius and
S. lentus. At the same time, the cfr gene was present in two of
the nine S. aureus isolates, and totally undetectable in S. hyicus,



S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, S. intermedius, and S. lentus
( **Table 5** ).


Detailed Analysis of Selected Isolates:
Species Determination
The 27 isolates were chosen for further detailed examination
on the basis of their ciprofloxacin and oxacillin from the disc
diffusion screening. There was interspecies and intraspecies
variation among the non-S. aureus species listed in **Table 3** .
The four ciprofloxacin-susceptible, oxacillin -susceptible isolates
examined, were S. hyicus. Again, four ciprofloxacin-resistant,
oxacillin susceptible isolates were S. hyicus. Of the four
ciprofloxacin-resistant, oxacillin -resistant isolates, four were
S. hyicus, two were S. intermedius and one was S. schleiferi
subsp. coagulans and S. lentus each. The study shows that, the
