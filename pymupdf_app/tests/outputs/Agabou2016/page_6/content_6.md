Kolar et al. [25], β-lactamases of the blaCTX-M-9 group are the
most frequently found in poultry. blaOXA-48 had been reported
in K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae from companion animals
(especially dogs, cats, and horses) but not birds [26].
Ciccozzi et al. [27] suggested that the potential transmission of multidrug-resistant E. coli clones from poultry
to humans seems to involve phylogroups A and B1 rather
than B2 and D. Phylogroups A and B1 are known to be
broad host-spectrum and could be found in all vertebrate
hosts, whereas B2 and D are narrow host-spectrum and
largely restricted to endothermic vertebrates, with B2 isolates as the most host-adapted [28]. In the adaptation process, mutation is the main driving evolutionary course in
the E. coli group A, whereas recombination is more prevalent in B1, B2, and D [29]. Phylogroups A, B1, and D
are more likely to have derived from the ancestral E. coli
lineages [30, 31], and the minor genetic differences observed between strains from the different source groups
could be related to their further evolutionary changes associated with host specificity [32]. This is another explanation of our results, as we found clonal human and avian
strains belonging mainly to phylogroups B1 and D.
Interestingly, we did not find any correlation between
the most important worldwide drug-resistant and virulent E. coli O25:H4-B2-ST131 clone (mainly responsible for urinary tract infections) and any avian strains.
This is an important finding, since the ST131 clone has
been previously isolated from clinical cases and the environment in Algeria [33, 34]. In contrast, a 90.9 %
similarity was found between avian and human
O25b:H4-ST131 ibeA-blaCTX-M-9+ strains in Spain

[35]. According to Giufrè et al. [36] and Cortès et al.

[37], ST131 clone is strongly predominant in human
ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli strains, but less in avian
ones in which it has not necessary to produce an ESBL,
and the acquisition of these enzyme-encoding plasmids
was probably achieved in a later stage of its evolution

[35, 38, 39]. The fact that a big number of our ExPEC
isolates belong to clusters exclusive to humans suggests
that most of human pathogenic strains may not be derived from extra-human (avian) ones. However, the
clonality among several avian and human isolates supports the idea of their evolution from a recent common
ancestor.
Conforming to Lee et al. [40], most fluoroquinoloneresistant E. coli in poultry are commensals that harbour mutations in gyrA or less frequently parC. These chromosomally
encoded genes were not investigated in our study, and instead
we focused on PMQRs because of plasmids’ extreme flexibility in the acquisition and transfer of resistance. The same
ciprofloxacin-resistant strains common in both chickens and
humans could also be acquired from the environment or from
companion animals (dogs and cats) [26, 41].



Conclusion


This study highlights a genetic proximity among avian commensal, human commensal, and pathogenic E. coli strains,
suggesting that poultry may play an important role in the
epidemiology of human E. coli infections in Constantine region. These findings may help us to understand the acquisition
and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, and may therefore help us to block its transmission pathways. Efforts are
required (i) to understand the ecology of bacterial communities present in animals and their environments, and (ii) to
elucidate the transmission dynamics to humans.
