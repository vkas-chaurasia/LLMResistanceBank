## Abstract

A preliminary epidemiological study of Salmonella contamination in laying-hen flocks was carried out in the regions of Annaba and Eltarf, Algeria, from March to October 2008 and March to November 2009. Our objectives were (i) to estimate the prevalence of infection by Salmonella spp. in seven pooled samples during the hens' laying period (ii) to identify the serotypes and antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of isolates, and (iii) to characterize the factors that may be related to Salmonella contamination in Algerian henhouses. For this purpose, 18 out of 22 operational laying-hen houses were sampled one to three times during these periods: once at the start of laying (pullets aged 22–31 weeks), once in the middle of laying (47–60 week) and once at the end of laying prior to depopulation (70–86 week). The flocks Salmonella status was assessed by collecting 2754 environmental samples that were analyzed according to the ISO 6579 method. The antibiotic resistance of Salmonella strains was tested as per the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The relationship between each potential risk factor and the Salmonella status of laying-hen flocks was evaluated by calculating the relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. Eight flocks tested positive for Salmonella spp., with a higher prevalence at the end of laying than at either the beginning or middle. Only 19 isolates were recovered from the 2754 samples analyzed and nine different serotypes identified. *S. Enteritidis* (n = 4) was the most prevalent serovar, along with *S. Kentucky* and *S. Hadar* (n = 3), followed by *S. Heidelberg*, *S. Manhattan* and *S. Virchow* (n = 2), whereas *S. Dublin*, *S. Typhimurium* and *S. Albany* were found only once. Thirteen isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. Of these, six were resistant to at least three different antimicrobial classes. Salmonella serovar Kentucky isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones with ciprofloxacin MIC ≥ 8 mg/L. Six risk indicators were identified as potentially related to the Salmonella status of layer houses.

## 1. Introduction

Non-typhoid *Salmonella* is a major bacterial pathogen and the second cause of food-borne diseases in Europe and worldwide. In France, *Salmonella* was isolated from 64% of food-borne outbreaks between 1996 and 2005. These *Salmonella* outbreaks were the cause of 49% of all reported cases. In the United States, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that approximately 40,000 cases of human salmonellosis were diagnosed annually in the 1990s, and that the annual number of non-typhoidal salmonellosis cases was about 1.4 million. In addition to the health consequences, human *Salmonella* infections have a significant financial impact.

In Algeria, poultry and egg productions have increased substantially since the mid-1980s, supported by an incentive policy. Poultry production has increased from 162,000 t in 1985 to 270,000 t in 1995, largely due to state subsidies. Concomitantly, several outbreaks of salmonellosis have been observed in Algeria during recent years in both humans and food animal production, particularly poultry. However, the public health consequences and economic impact of *Salmonella* in the Algerian poultry breeding sector are unknown because there are no epidemiological surveillance systems or monitoring programs for *Salmonella* infections in this country.

The main aims of this study were therefore (i) to determine the prevalence of *Salmonella* in laying-hen flocks in 2 regions of Algeria, (ii) identify the serotypes present in these regions and their antimicrobial resistance, and finally (iii) to evaluate the risk factors that might influence the *Salmonella* contamination of laying-hen flocks.

## 2. Material and Methods

**2.1 Study Design**
The study was conducted in two regions in the eastmost part of Algeria from March 2008 to November 2009. The list and location of farms were obtained from official veterinary authorities for these regions and through our epidemiological investigation. During these two years, 22 operational layer houses were studied in both regions. In all, 18 out of 22 layer houses with only one laying flock participated in the study for both years. Flock sizes ranged from 2400 to 7200 hens.

**2.2 Time of Sampling**
Samples were taken in two successive years, from May to October 2008 and March to November 2009. Thirteen hen flocks were sampled three times, but layer house access difficulties resulted in two flocks being sampled twice and three only once. The first visit was scheduled at the beginning of the laying period (pullets aged 22–31 weeks) for 15 hen flocks, the second about halfway through laying (47–60 weeks) for 14 flocks, and the third visit was late in the laying period, prior to depopulation (maximum 9 weeks before) for 17 flocks.

**2.3 Questionnaire Design**
A questionnaire was filled in during an onsite interview while collecting samples. It was used to gather information on the general characteristics of laying-hen flocks, dead-bird management, control of rodents and other domestic animals, biosecurity measures, farm staff and visitors, vaccination and administration of antibiotics.

**2.4 Sample Collection**
A total of 2754 samples were collected over two periods. The following seven pooled samples were collected from each flock at each visit: two pools of 15 fresh feces samples from under the cages, one pool of five fecal samples from the cages themselves, one pool of seven surface swabs, one pool of seven dust swabs from inside and outside the cages, and two pools of feed and water samples.

**2.5 Bacteriological Analysis of Samples**
The bacteriological analysis of samples was carried out according to standard norm ISO 6579: 2002. Salmonella isolates were serotyped by a slide agglutination test with polyvalent O and H antiserum. The Kauffmann-White scheme was used to serotype the different isolates.

**2.6 Antibiotic Resistance Analysis**
Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard. The antimicrobial agents tested were ampicillin (10 µg), amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (20, 10 µg), cephalothin (30 µg), cefotaxime (30 µg), ceftazidime (30 µg), sulphonamides (300 µg), cotrimoxazole (1.25/23.75 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), streptomycin (10 µg), kanamycin (30 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), chloramphenicol (30 µg), nalidixic acid (30 µg), ofloxacin (5 µg) and enrofloxacin (5 µg).

**2.7 Statistical Analyses**
Data were analyzed using Epi-Info® software. Only univariate analyses were performed due to the small sample. Statistical analyses were limited to Fisher's Exact tests and calculation of Relative Risks (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals.

## 3. Results

**3.1 Salmonella Prevalence**
Eight of the 18 flocks tested positive for *Salmonella* spp. Salmonella contamination was higher at the end of the laying period than at the beginning or middle. The 70- to 86-wk-old hens had the highest prevalence of *Salmonella* (7/17, 41.17%), followed by the 22- to 31-wk-old hens, which had a prevalence of 20% (3/15). *Salmonella* prevalence was lowest halfway through laying (47–60 week) with 7.14% (1/14).

**3.2 Serovars Encountered and Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns**
The serotyping of 19 *Salmonella* strains revealed nine serovars from eight positive flocks. The six most prevalent serovars were *S. Enteritidis* (n=4), *S. Kentucky* (n=3), *S. Hadar* (n=3), *S. Virchow* (n=2), *S. Heidelberg* (n=2) and *S. Manhattan* (n=2). Thirteen isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial. Twelve isolates exhibited resistance to nalidixic acid.

**3.3 Risk Indicators Associated with the Salmonella Status of Flocks**
Six out of fifteen risk indicators were considered as pertinent indicators since their RR was ≥2. *Salmonella* contamination of flocks was more frequent when (i) the layer house was easily accessible, (ii) the buildings were not disinfected before pullets were loaded, (iii) ventilation was poor, (iv) dead hens were stored on the farms for at least 1 week, (v) rodents were observed inside the henhouse, and when (vi) cages were dry cleaned only.

## 4. Discussion

**4.1 Prevalence**
To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological study of *Salmonella* contamination in laying-hen flocks ever carried out in the Annaba and Eltarf regions of Algeria. The results of our own study show that eight flocks (44.4%) tested positive for *Salmonella* during the laying period. Our results show that *Salmonella* prevalence was higher at the end of the laying period than at the beginning or middle. The proportion of positive samples in our study is quite low—only 19, or 0.68%.

**4.2 Serovars and antibiotic resistance**
The distribution of *Salmonella* serovars identified in the present study was particularly heterogeneous. *Salmonella Enteritidis* was the most commonly isolated serovar in terms of number of isolates (n = 4), but it was recovered in only one henhouse. In our research project, *Salmonella Kentucky* was recovered from three different laying-hen flocks. In this study, the number of isolates resistant to at least three antimicrobials is relatively small. The overall limited antimicrobial usage in egg-producing laying hens in our study is in accordance with previous studies. However, the presence of isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones (*S. Kentucky*) is more worrying.

**4.3 Risk Indicators**
We identified six risk indicators with RR values ≥ 2. The absence of a fence at the entrance of henhouses appears to influence the *Salmonella* status of laying-hen flocks. *Salmonella* was found more frequently on farms where non-essential visitors have easy access to the layer houses (58.3% vs 16.7%).

## 5. Conclusion
The current study provides baseline data on the Salmonella contamination of Algerian laying-hen flocks and some useful information on the presence of Salmonella, antimicrobial resistance and the associated risk factors for laying-hen farms. We showed that eight flocks tested positive for Salmonella among 18 flocks sampled and that layer life stages also affected the prevalence of Salmonella recovered from the seven pooled samples. The results of this study also illustrate that, despite using an extended sampling protocol, the proportion of positive samples remains very low (19/2754). We also revealed the presence of multiple Salmonella serovars, and a small proportion of antibiotic-resistant isolates, which may suggest a moderate use of antibiotics in Algerian laying-hen flocks. In the present study, we report here the presence of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Kentucky in the studied flocks that coincide with its emergence in other countries throughout Africa and the Middle East. Six risk indicators were identified as being potentially linked to the Salmonella contamination of laying-hen houses.
