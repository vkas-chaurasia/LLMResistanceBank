This study focused on 77 isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis collected during 2009 to 2013
from healthy and sick chickens and environmental farm samples in Tunisia. Resistance to 14 antimicro
bials and the encoding genes were analyzed. 66, 26, 6.5, 3.9 and 1.3% were pan-susceptible or showed

resistance to nalidixic acid (Asp87 to Tyr and Asp87 to Asn substitutions in GyrA), ampicillin (blaTEM-1-like

and blaSHV), sulfonamides (sul1and sul3) and streptomycin (strB), respectively. A single isolate with intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was positive for qnrB, whereas qnrA, qnrS or aac(6 [′] )-Ib-cr were not

detected. The virulotype of the isolates was established by testing ten virulence genes. The orgA, ssaQ,

mgtC, siiD, sopB genes, located on Salmonella pathogenicity islands, and spvC of the serotype-specific

virulence plasmid, were common to all isolates. In contrast, the prophage-associated sopE-1, sodC1 and

gipA genes and the fimbrial bcfC gene were variably represented. All isolates except one contained the

virulence plasmid, which appeared either alone or together with one or more additional plasmids. One

isolate carried a single plasmid of ca. 90 Kb which may be derived from the virulence plasmid (60 Kb).

Overall, seven resistotypes, six virulotypes and six plasmid profiles were identified. XbaI-PFGE revealed

four related pulsotypes (X1–X4), with 80% of the isolates sharing the X1 pattern. The latter isolates

exhibited different resistance, virulence and plasmid profiles, suggesting that mobile genetic elements,

particularly prophages and plasmids, are of central importance for the evolution and adaptation of S.

**Introduction**


Salmonella enterica is a major zoonotic food-borne pathogen
causing outbreaks and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in humans
worldwide [1,2]. Among more than 2500 serotypes of S. enterica,

serotype Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis), which is mainly transmitted
through consumption of contaminated poultry meat and egg products [3], is the primary cause of human salmonellosis in many
countries, including Tunisia [4–6]. The infection develops with
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps, and is usually
self-limiting. However, S. enterica can also cause severe invasive
infections, particularly in immune-compromised hosts, the elderly
and the very young [7,8]. Antimicrobial agents are not essential
to control most Salmonella infections, but severe, life-threatening
infections require treatment. In these instances, fluoroquinolones
and broad spectrum cephalosporins are the drugs of choice [8].
Development of resistance to these key antimicrobials is hence a
major problem for public health.
