antibiotic resistance as modification of the antibiotic by
aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AphA, AadE, Sat),
enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic by β-lactamase
and modification of the DNA gyrase target, mutations
in 23S rRNA genes were included for aminoglycosides,
beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and tetracyclines, respectively [48, 49]. The multidrug efflux pump
CmeABC has been involved in the resistance mechanisms of _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli_ to tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and beta-lactams [49].
Molecular biological methods were used for detection
of antibiotic resistance determinants either using DNA
isolated from cultures or that of non-cultured bacteria

[27, 37]. All isolates of this study which were resistant to
ciprofloxacin carried a mutation of the amino acid 86 of
the _gyr_ A resulting in a change from threonine to isoleucine. This mutation was detected also in 3 DNA samples extracted from skimmed milk. The MAMA–PCR
protocol allowed the detection of the _gyr_ A mutation and
PCR–RFLP was confirming the mutation from (ACA to
ATA) of amino acid 86. This result was in agreement with
previous reports showing that both methods are simple,
reliable, rapid tools that can be used as screening methods [27, 37]. In _Campylobacter_, resistance to erythromycin is chromosomally encoded by an alteration of the
23S rRNA gene. High level resistance to erythromycin is
caused by mutations at position 2074 and/or 2075 of the
domain V of this gene. In this study the mutations were
neither detected by MAMA–PCR nor by PCR–RFLP.
The _tet_ (O) gene is known to be responsible for tetracycline resistance in _Campylobacter_ isolates [29]. In this
study, only 54.5 % of the tetracycline resistant isolates
harboured the _tet_ (O) gene. The _tet_ (A) gene also plays role
in resistance to tetracycline [22]. The efflux gene _tet_ (A)
is coding for an approximately 46 kDa membrane-bound
efflux protein for membrane-associated proteins and is
involved in the export of tetracycline from the cell [50].
In this study, using the recommended primers for _tet_ (A)
amplification [18] PCR products of 696 bp instead of
888 bp were obtained. DNA sequencing of amplicons and
database search resulted in 99.0 % homology to a partial
putative integral membrane protein and a putative periplasmic protein. Hence, a new PCR assay based on _tet_ (A)
gene sequences for _C. jejuni_ (acc. no. JX891464) and
_C. coli_ (acc. no. JX891463) was developed. Parameters
such as limit of detection, limit of quantification, PCR
efficiency and specificity were considered during an inhouse validation process. Amplicon length was 486 and
the amplicons were sequenced to confirm the identity.
The _tet_ (A) gene was much more frequently identified in
the Kenyan _Campylobacter_ isolates than _tet_ (O) (35 vs 13).
To the best of our knowledge this is the first report
on the status of antibiotic susceptibility of thermophilic



_Campylobacter_ from chicken in Kenya. High level of
resistance to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and nalidixic
acid as well as multidrug resistance was detected previously in Kenya. In Kenya, this problem is reported to be
caused by the increasing rate of unregulated over-thecounter sale without prescriptions of these antibiotics,
mainly to humans self-treatment of suspected infections
and to a lesser extent for use in animals [51]. These findings also demonstrate the potential for antibiotic-resistant
bacteria to spread through the food chain from animals
treated with antibiotics for humans. Such misuse and
overuse may have resulted in the selection of resistant
mutants or acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes from
other organisms through the process of genetic exchange.
It is recommendable that a long-term local surveillance
programme is adopted for monitoring changes in resistance among _Campylobacter_ isolates. Efforts to establish
at least a National Laboratory with facilities for performing phenotyping and genotyping methods is highly recommended. Emphasis should be given on educational
advertising to reduce the input of antibiotics in animal
breeding to minimize the potential hazard for humans.
