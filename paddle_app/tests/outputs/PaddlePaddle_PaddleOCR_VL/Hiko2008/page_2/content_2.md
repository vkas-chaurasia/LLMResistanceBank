## Materials and Methods

## Ethical considerations

The research project was approved by the Academic Commission of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

## Study area

Over a period of 7 months (October 2006 to April 2007), a prevalence survey of  $ E.\ coli $  O157:H7 was conducted on meat samples obtained from legally registered butcher shops, municipal abattoirs, and selected export abattoirs at Debre-Zeit and Modjo towns, which are allocated at 45 and 70 km, respectively from the Addis Ababa, the capital city of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia.

## Sample collection, handling and transport

A total of 738 raw meat samples were collected from municipal abattoirs (n=177), export abattoirs (n=433) and butcher shops (n=128 (Table 1)). The meat samples were from bovines (n=250), sheep (n=243) and goat (n=245). Of the 738 meat samples, 406 (55%) and 333 (45%) were collected from Debre Zeit and Modjo Towns, respectively. All the meat samples were ready-to-eat fresh and collected aseptically, placed into sterile containers, and transported to the Microbiology Laboratory of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Addis Ababa University, located at Debre Zeit. Samples were transported in ice boxes and analyzed within 6 to 12 hours.

## Sample preparation and selective enrichment

Enrichment cultures for each meat sample were conducted by combining 25g of each sample with 225ml of tryptone soya broth (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) supplemented with 20 mg/l novobiocin (Sigma, Germany) in a stomacher bag, homogenizing for at least 2 minutes in a stomacher (Lab Blender 400, Seward Medical, London, UK) and incubating at  $ 37^{\circ} $ C for 16 to 18 h.

### Culture and isolation of E. coli O157:H7

All enriched meat samples were subsequently subcultured onto eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar (Difco Laboratories, USA) for primary screening of  $ E.\ coli $  and incubated aerobically at  $ 37^{\circ}C $  for 24 hours. Suspected colonies of  $ E.\ coli $  (greenish metallic sheen appearance with dark purple centers) were biochemically identified using API 20E gallery (API20E/20100, bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and subsequently they were further screened for  $ E.\ coli $  O157:H7. In brief, 2-3 biochemically confirmed  $ E.\ coli $  were subcultured on Sorbitol MacConkey Agar (Oxoid), supplemented with 0.05 mg/l cefixime and 2.5 mg/l tellurite (Oxoid) (SMAC-CT) and incubated at  $ 37^{\circ}C $  for 18 to 24 hours. Following the end of the incubation period, the SMAC-CT agar plates were examined for the presence of non-sorbitol fermenter colonies and subsequently they were further processed for serological identification. The type strain  $ E.\ coli $  O157:H7 (ATCC 43895) was placed into 10 ml of Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) (Oxoid) and incubated for 24 hours at  $ 37^{\circ}C $ . The resulting culture was streaked out on SMAC-CT agar and incubated for 24 hours at  $ 37^{\circ}C $ . This was used as a positive control.

## Serological identification

All non-sorbitol fermenting colonies from the SMAC-CT agar were subjected to slide agglutination with the E. coli O157 Latex test kit (Oxoid). The latex beads were coated with antibodies which bind to any O157 or H7 antigens on the test organisms, forming a visible antigen antibody precipitate [13]. Colonies giving a precipitation reaction were confirmed as E. coli O157:H7 positive.

## Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The isolated E. coli O157:H7 strains were tested for antibiotic resistance to thirteen antimicrobial agents obtained from Oxoid [amikacin (AK) (30  $ \mu $ g), ampicillin (AMP) (10  $ \mu $ g), cephalothin (KF), (30  $ \mu $ g), chloramphenicol (C) (30  $ \mu $ g), gentamicin (CN) (10  $ \mu $ g), kanamycin (K) (30  $ \mu $ g), nalidixic acid (30  $ \mu $ g) (NA), norfloxacin (NOR) (10  $ \mu $ g), polymyxin B (PB) (300 units), streptomycin (S) (10  $ \mu $ g), trimethoprim (W) (5  $ \mu $ g), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (SXT) (25  $ \mu $ g) and tetracycline (TE) (30  $ \mu $ g)] using the disc diffusion method according to the criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) [14]. The isolates were classified as sensitive, intermediate, and resistant using the breakpoints of the NCCLS [14]. A standard reference strain of E. coli
