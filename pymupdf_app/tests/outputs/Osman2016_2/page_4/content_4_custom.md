that were resistant and intermediate were categorized as nonsusceptible while the sensitive strains were categorized as
susceptible.


DNA Extraction
Bacterial DNA from the 27 staphylococci were isolated from
an overnight cultures using the boiling protocol previously
described (Sowmya et al., 2012). DNA precipitates were
resuspended in an appropriate volume of Tris-EDTA buffer
solution.


PCR for Detection of Genes Encoding
Antimicrobial Resistance
The 27 Staphylococcus species isolates were confirmed as MSSA,
MRSA, methicillin-susceptible non-Staphylococcus aureus
(non-MSSA), and methicillin-resistant non-Staphylococcus
aureus (non-MRSA) molecularly to identify mecA (the goldstandard reference method for this analysis). In addition,
four antimicrobial resistance genes responsible for quinolone
resistance (gyrA, gyrB, and grlA genes) which are habitually found
in S. aureus according resistance in the quinolone-resistancedetermining-regions (QRDRs) and responsible for quinolone
resistance (gyrA, gyrB, and grlA genes) and the cfr gene which
confers resistance to five antibiotic classes (oxazolidinones,
phenicols, streptogramin compounds, lincosamidins, and
pleuromutilins usually referred to as PhLOPSA phenotype) were
also amplified. Annealing temperatures and oligonucleotides
used are presented in **Table 1** . The PCR runs included a
reagent positive and negative control (without template DNA).
Three independent PCR amplifications were carried out with
a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer, Weiterstadt,
Germany). Two microliters of template DNA was added to
23 mL of distilled sterile water, and finally 25 mL of reaction



mixture containing 10mM Tris-HCl (pH8.3), 50mM KCl, 2.5mM
MgCl2, 100 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1 mM of each
primer and 3U of Taq polymerase were added. The amplicons
were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel in
TBE buffer.


RESULTS


Identification of Staphylococci
We identified 27 staphylococcal isolates belonging to five
different staphylococcal species. These included S. hyicus (n =
10, 37%), S. aureus (n = 9, 33.3%), S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans
(n = 4, 14.8%), S. intermedius (n = 3, 11.1%), and S. lentus
(n = 1, 3.7%).


Phenotypic Virulence Assays
Summarized results of examining the 27 staphylococci isolates for
factors that possibly contribute to their virulence are presented in
**Table 2** .


Haemolysin Production
Haemolytic activity on plates with 5% defibrinated rabbit or
sheep blood was established. In the strains showing hemolytic
activity, the three patterns of haemolysis (β, α, and γ) were
observed, 66.7% were demonstrated to be β-hemolytic, 22.2%
were α-hemolytic, and 10.1% were γ-hemolytic.


Cytotoxicity Assay
All of the 27 Staphylococcus isolates were cytotoxic to Vero cells.


Biofilm Producing Phenotype
We found a highly resistant pattern among biofilm producers
in comparison with non-biofilm producers. Among the 7/9
vancomycin resistant S. aureus isolates, they were also a
