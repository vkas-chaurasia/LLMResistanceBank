(1997; 88%). Resistance to β-lactams involved ampicillin only; our result was lower than those reported by
Mc Kenzie and Nadeau (2006), Al-Bahry et al. (2007),
and Dinh Nam Lâm et al. (2000), which were between
36 and 88.89%. Acquired resistance to aminoglycosides
is not common in _Enterobacteriaceae_ (Courvalin and
Philippon, 1989); the only restraint in our study was
resistance to kanamycin, although this antimicrobial
agent is not used in poultry. Our result, probably due
to the cross resistance with neomycin, was in agreement with those obtained by Brisabois et al. (1997),
Millemann (1998), Dinh Nam Lâm et al. (2000), and
Mc Kenzie and Nadeau (2006). The susceptibility to
polypeptides was confirmed by Aboun (2005); on the
other hand, the susceptibility to chloramphenicol was
reversed by Brisabois et al. (1997), Dinh Nam Lâm et
al. (2000), and Al-Bahry et al. (2007), who noted 91,
25, and 14% resistance rates, respectively. Out of 24
_Salmonella_ Heidelberg strains tested, only 5 were susceptible to all antimicrobials used. The 19 remaining
were mostly resistant to nalidixic acid. In Canada, this
serotype would be particularly resistant to the third
generation cephalosporins (PICRA, 2006). The resistance of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis to furans was confirmed
by the results of Espigares et al. (2006). In our study,
_Salmonella_ Typhimurium was resistant to quinolones,
furans, cyclones, and sulphonamides. This multidrug
resistance could facilitate the spread of this serotype
and the development of other mechanisms of resistance
to other antimicrobial classes. Indeed, in the literature,
_Salmonella_ Typhimurium was resistant to several antimicrobial agents with a special surge of resistance to
nalidixic acid (Brisabois et al. 1997; Heurtin-Le Corre
et al., 1999). _Salmonella_ Hadar, resistant to quinolones
and tetracycline, was multiresistant in the study of Espigares et al. (2006).


_**Genetic Support of Resistance**_

The _Salmonella_ strains resistant to nalidixic acid and
nitrofurantoїnes were not transferable, confirming the
chromosomal support of these resistances. The majority of resistance markers were transferred; the most
common were ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole,
sulphonamides, and kanamycin. In our study, a plasmid
grouping identified the same classes (Com1 and F1me)
as described by Chaslus-Dancla (1980) in France and
found in a national study on enterobacteria isolated in
western Algeria (Barka, 2002). The results obtained by
physical analysis of plasmid content of transconjugants
implied that the spread of resistance characteristics of
studied _Salmonella_ strains is provided by high molecular weight plasmids. This study allowed us to highlight
diverse serotypes, with a predominance of _Salmonella_
Heidelberg. The free flow of the same _Salmonella_ serotypes and the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance
and plasmid groups, observed in a limited area of study,
is an alarming reality. The fight against avian salmonellosis requires the application of control measures at



various levels of the production chain. It would also
require the development of an effective plan of epidemiological surveillance, and for this, similar and complementary studies must be conducted in Algeria and
will include the identification of different phage types
and their distribution, monitoring the geographical
spread and resistance evolution of identified serotypes,
the spread of resistant _Salmonella_ strains from animals
to humans, and the identification of resistance genes.
The use of different techniques in molecular biology is
essential, particularly those based on the analysis of the
restriction pattern of plasmids should be generalized.
