**Fig. 5** Amplification of conserved regions (5′-CS and 3′-CS) of class 1 integron and integron profiles (IPs) detected in _Salmonella_ isolates from poultry meat and humans. _Asterisks_ represent the bands selected for sequencing. Lane N: negative control, lane L: DNA ladder (100 bp), lane P: Positive
control, lane 1: IP I _(S._ Derby, duck), lane 2: IP II ( _S._ Kiel, chicken), lanes 3,4: IP III (untypable, duck & _S._ Rubislaw, chicken), lanes 5, 6,10,11, 12: IP IV, V, IX,
X ( _S._ Typhimurium, chicken), lanes 8, 9: IPs VII, VIII ( _S._ Typhimurium, humans)



which showed 100 % identity with _aadA4_ previously
identified in class I integron of _S._ Newport (CP006631)
and plasmid of _S._ Indiana (ref|NG_041636). In addition,
the 1600 bp integron carried gene cassette containing
_dfrA15_ gene that showed 100 % amino acid and nucleotide homology with _dfrA15_ gene previously reported in _S._
_enterica_ strain (KM823524).
The _sat_ gene detected in the gene cassette of class
I integron (650 bp) of _S._ Typhimurium in this study
was previously identified in _S._ Kedougou (DQ284538)

[27] and plasmid of _S._ Choleraesuis (AY509004) [28].
Moreover, the 1500 bp amplicon identified in _S._ Typhimurium contained _estX_ - _sat_ gene cassette that is
identical to _est_ X gene previously identified in _S._ Typhimurium (EF051039), _sat_ gene of _S._ Choleraesuis plasmid
(ref|NG_036624) and SC-B67 strain (AY509004). Point
mutations were observed in _estX_ - _sat_ gene cassette in this
study compared to the classical _estX_ and _sat_ genes (99 %
nucleotide identity); these genes displayed both missense and silent mutations. The nucleotide number 763
of _estX_ was exchanged from T to C resulting in exchange
of amino acid (phenylalanine) into leucine. Furthermore,
at codon 288 (histidine TAC→tyrosine CAC) and 290
(threonine ACA→alanine GCA). Silent mutations were
recorded at nucleotides 894 (GTC→GTA, alanine), 903
(TAT→TAC, tyrosine) and 927 (GTC→GTA, both are
valine). While in _sat_ gene, silent mutations were detected
at codon 418 (ACT→ACC, tyrosine), 428 (GTC→GTA,
valine), 451 and 453 (GGC→GGT, GGA→GGG both
are glycine). Amino acids replacement was recorded
in _sat_ gene at codon 459 (lysine AAA→glutamic acid



GAA), 462 (proline CCG→leucine CTG) and 465 (isoleucine ATC→threonine ACC). Nonsense mutation
was predicted at nucleotide 1418 (serine TCA→stop
codon TAA). Antimicrobial drug resistance can occur by
point mutations in the bacterial genome [29] or through
mobile genetic elements called integrons which are able
to disseminate the antimicrobial resistance among the
enterobacteriaceae by horizontal transfer [30].
In fact, this study reports for the first time the presence
of _aadA2_ plus _lnuF_ genes within the same integron gene
cassette of 1900 bp in _S.typhimurium_ from chicken. The
nucleotide sequence of _aadA2_ and _lnuF_ genes, respectively showed 99 and 100 % identity with _aadA2_ and _lnuF_
genes previously reported in _S. enterica_ serovar Stanley
(EU118119). Moreover, the _aadA2_ gene had 99 % amino
acid and nucleotide homology with _aadA2_ previously
identified in _S._ Typhimurium isolated from food-animals
and humans in Mexico (FJ460233) [31]. On the other hand,
the 1900 bp of class I integron was found to harbor _aadA2_
plus _dfrA12_ in _S. enterica_ serovar Typhimurium isolated
from food-animals, chicken and humans in Malaysia [32].
The nucleotide sequence of _aadA2_ showed four
base differences from other _aadA2_ in GenBank
reported cassettes and this caused point mutation
which are responsible for an alteration in the codon
60 (glycine GGA→arginine CGA), codon 61(isoleucine ATC→threonine ACC), codon 62 (asparagine
AAC→aspartic acid GAC) and codon 105 (proline
CCT→TCT serine) (Fig. 6). Similarly, point mutation
in the _aadA2_ gene of NTS _enterica_ isolates was reported

[29].
