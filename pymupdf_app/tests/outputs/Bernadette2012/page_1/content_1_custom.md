Thermophilic _Campylobacters_ are major causes of gastroenteritis in human. The main risk factor of infection is consumption of
contaminated or by cross-contaminated poultry meat. In Cˆote d’Ivoire, gastroenteritis is usually observed but no case of human
campylobacteriosis has been formally reported to date. The aims of this study were to determine prevalence and antimicrobial
resistance of _Campylobacter jejuni_ and _Campylobacter coli_ isolated from chickens ceaca in commercial slaughter in Abidjan.
Between May and November 2009, one hundred and nineteen (119) chicken caeca samples were collected and analyzed by passive
filtration method followed by molecular identification (PCR). From these 119 samples, 76 (63.8%) were positive to _Campylobacter_
tests. Among the positive colonies, 51.3% were _C. jejuni_ and 48.7% were _C. coli_ . Of the 39 _C. jejuni_ isolates, 79.5%, 38.5%, 17.9%,
10.3%, and 7.7% were, respectively, resistant, to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin. Among
the 37 isolates of _C. coli_, 78.4%, 43.2%, 13.5%, 8.1%, and 0% were resistant, respectively, to the same antibiotics. In conclusion, we
reported in this study the presence of high _Campylobacter_ contamination of the studied chickens. Molecular identification of the
bacteria was performed and determination of high resistance to antimicrobials of the fluoroquinolone family was revealed.



**1. Introduction**


_Campylobacter bacteria_ are Gram negative, curved, highly
mobile, and microaerophilic. Thermophilic _Campylobacter_
species, particularly _Campylobacter jejuni_ and _Campylobacter_
_coli_, have been recognized as a major cause of acute
bacterial gastroenteritis in humans since 1970 and it is
estimated that _Campylobacter_ spp. are responsible for 400–
500 millions cases of diarrhea each year worldwide [1–4].
In developing countries, incidence of children under 5 years
old is estimated to 40 000 cases for 100 000 persons per year

[5, 6] and according to World Health Organization (WHO)
this incidence is underestimated.
Unpasteurized milk, water, and foods of animal origin are
potential sources of contaminations [7–9], but the major risk
factor for campylobacteriosis for humans is the consumption



of undercooked poultry and the handling of raw poultry [9–
16].
Most _Campylobacter_ infections do not need to be treated
with antimicrobial agents. However, in a subset of patients
_Campylobacter_ may cause severe complications and increased
risk for death and therefore requires treatment [17–19].
When clinical treatment is necessary, fluoroquinolones
(Ciprofloxacin, e.g.) or macrolides (Erythromycin) are currently used because of their large spectra activity on enteric
pathogens [20, 21].
However, antimicrobial drug resistance in _Campylobacter_
infections has increased dramatically in many countries
during the 1990s. This emergence of _strains_ resistance
to antimicrobials provoked controversy over the use of
antimicrobials in animal food production [22, 23].
