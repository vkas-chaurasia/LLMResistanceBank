Abstract


Background: Chicken is a rich source of meat protein and is increasingly being consumed in urban areas in Kenya.
However, under poor hygienic environment, raw chicken meat presents an ideal substrate supporting the growth
of pathogenic Escherichia coli and Coliform bacteria indicating the potential presence of other pathogenic bacteria; this
may constitute a major source of food-borne illnesses in humans. This study sought to assess the microbiological
quality and safety of raw chicken meat sold in Nairobi, Kenya by determining the E. coli/coliform contamination levels
as well as the antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogenicity of E. coli isolated.

Findings: We conducted a Cross-sectional study to collect two hundred raw chicken samples that were randomly
purchased between the periods of August 2011-February 2012. Enumeration of bacteria was done using 3 M Petri film
E. coli/Coliform count plates, isolation and identification of E. coli through standard cultural and biochemical testing,
antimicrobial susceptibilities interpreted according to criteria set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(2012) while Polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine presence of virulence genes in isolated E. coli.
Data was analyzed using SPSS version 17.0. Contamination rates were 97% and 78% respectively for Coliform bacteria
and E. coli. Seventy six percent of samples fell under the unacceptable microbial count limit (>100 cfu/ml) and
significant differences in the E. coli/coliform counts (p < 0.001) were observed among the chicken retail outlets
with samples from supermarkets having the lowest level of contamination compared to the rest of the retail outlets.
Seventy five percent of the isolates were resistant to at least one of the 12 antibiotics tested with resistance to tetracycline
being the highest at 60.3%. In addition 40.4% E. coli isolates were positive for the ten virulence genes tested.

Conclusion: Raw retail chicken meats in Nairobi are not only highly contaminated, but also with potentially
pathogenic and multi-drug resistant strains of E. coli. It will be important for public health authorities and retail
chicken processing outlets to collaborate in ensuring adherence to set out principles of hygienic processing and
handling of chicken meats in order to reduce potential risks of infection.

Findings
Background
Ensuring safe food supply has been one of the major
challenges and concerns for producers, consumers and
public health officials in both developing and developed
countries. This is because foods excessively contaminated
with pathogenic and spoilage micro-organism are undesirable and can cause food borne illnesses [1-3]. Such illnesses

cost billions of dollars in medical care and sometimes even
result to death [4]. Several epidemiological reports have
implicated foods from animal origin as major vehicles
associated with illnesses caused by food borne pathogens

[5-7]. Coliform bacteria, especially fecal coliforms, are
good microbial indicators of the potential presence of disease causing bacteria and also show the general sanitary
quality of the food. Food contamination by Escherichia
coli is closely associated with fecal contamination. This is
because E. coli are the most prevalent commensal enteric
bacteria in animals and humans and are also important
