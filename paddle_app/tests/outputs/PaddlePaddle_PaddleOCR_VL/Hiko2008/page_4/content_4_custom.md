Hiko et al. – Escherichia coli O157:H7 in retail raw meat products of Ethiopia

J Infect Developing Countries 2008; 2(5): 389-393.

E. coli O157:H7 was recovered at lower prevalence in meat samples obtained from sheep (2.5%) and goat (2%) than beef in the present study. This finding is in close agreement with the reported prevalence of 2.9% in the United Kingdom  $ [17] $  and 2% in Canada  $ [21] $ . This might be due to low fecal prevalence of  $ E\ coli\ O157:H7 $  in these animals, which results in relatively low risk of contamination. The overall variations in the prevalence of  $ E.\ coli\ O157:H7 $  may be a result of different sampling techniques employed and laboratory methodologies used, and may also be due to the reason that the studies were conducted in different countries at different times. Since virulence gene detection was not performed, the data derived in this study should only be considered presumptive; however, the high prevalence of O157:H7 strains identified with the limited available methodology gives cause for concern.

The E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated in this study were all found susceptible to most antibiotics tested. Similar findings have been reported by other researchers  $ [16,23] $ . However, resistant strains do exist mainly to ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, cephalothin and sulphamethoxazole  $ [6,18,23,24] $  and were detected in the present study. Multidrug resistance was found in 22.6% of the strains. Similar findings have been observed in other studies  $ [6,7] $ .

Although other enterohemorrhagic  $ E.\ coli $  (EHEC) serotypes and the virulence factors of  $ E.\ coli $  O157:H7 were not investigated because of laboratory facility limitations, this study revealed that various retail raw meats products from foods of animal origin are often contaminated with  $ E.\ coli $  O157:H7, suggesting possible risks of infection to people through consumption of raw/undercooked meat or cross-contamination of other foods.

The available evidence also shows that meats from foods of animal origin serve as potential vehicles for transmitting  $ E.\ coli $  O157:H7; interruption of transmission to humans should be given a high priority. The importance of proper handling and cooking of foods of animal origin are probably as important in preventing  $ E.\ coli $  O157:H7 infections as they are in preventing Salmonella and Campylobacter infections.

Coordinated actions are needed to reduce or eliminate the risks posed by this organism at various stages in the food chain. These include Good Agricultural practice (GAP), Good Manufacturing practice (GMP), and Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) at every stage of the meat supply chain, from the farm through to the abattoir, to the retailer, and to those involved with the handling and processing of such raw meat products in the home environment. Antibiotic resistance in most strains in this study is low. However, MDR organisms may become a public health risk should they enter the food chain.
