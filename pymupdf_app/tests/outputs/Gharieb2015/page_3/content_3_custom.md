diarrhoeic children in Gambia [14] and this confirms the
zoonotic importance of the former serotypes.


**Antibiotic susceptibility testing**
All _Salmonella_ isolates were tested for their susceptibility towards antimicrobial drugs (Table 2). The results
highlighted the higher resistance of the isolates to
erythromycin and tetracycline (100 %, each), followed
by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (91.7 %), trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (83.3 %), streptomycin, nalidixic acid,
ampicillin-sulbactam (75 %, each), gentamycin, ampicillin (66.7 %, each), chloramphenicol (58.3 %), ciprofloxacin (25 %) and ceftriaxone (16.7 %). This isn’t surprising
because these antibiotics are cheap, easily affordable and
commonly used in humans and poultry without prescription. In poultry, these drugs are used either for therapeutic purposes or as growth promoters added to the feed
leading to the development of resistance in the enteric
bacterial flora of poultry. Subsequently the pathogenic
bacteria such as _Salmonella_ may acquire resistance from
this enteric flora and transfer this resistance to human’s
strains through food chain leading to the emergence of
MDR _Salmonella_ strains that constitute a public health
risk and potentially affect the efficacy of drug treatment
in humans. It was obvious from Table 2 that 100 % of _Sal-_
_monella_ spp. isolated from poultry meat were resistant
to each of erythromycin and tetracycline, 9 (90 %) were
resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 8 (80 %) showing
resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 7 (70 %)
exhibiting resistance to each of streptomycin, ampicillinsulbactam, nalidixic acid and gentamycin. Moreover, the
lower resistance rates to chloramphenicol (50 %), ciprofloxacin (30 %) and ceftriaxone (10 %) were observed.



Nearly similar resistance rate to ampicillin, streptomycin,
nalidixic acid, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was recorded in _Salmonella_ spp. isolated from
chicken meat in Pakistan [15]. On the contrary, the lower
resistance rate to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin corroborates with others in India [11].
Table 2 also showed that all _Salmonella_ isolates of
human origin were resistant to ampicillin, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin-sulbactam,
trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Conversely,
the resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamycin was found
in 50 % of the isolates. On the other hand, none of the
isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin. Consistent with
our results, a higher resistance rate (100 %) to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and tetracyclines was recorded in _S._
Typhimurium strains isolated from diarrhoeic patients in
Kenya [16]. Another worrisome situation in this study is
that, 50 % of _Salmonella_ isolates from diarrhoeic patients
were resistant to ceftriaxone and gentamycin. This is
of particular concern because the extended spectrum
cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are the antibiotics
of choice for treatment of invasive salmonellosis in children and the emergence of resistance toward these drugs
could be attributed to inappropriate use of them in treatment of _Salmonella_ infections in humans. The higher
susceptibility of _S_ . Typhimurium isolated from human
source to ciprofloxacin (100 %) in this study may be due
to discriminate use of this drug because it is relatively
expensive, not easily affordable to all people, not sold in
private pharmacies without prescription. This result corroborates the findings of other investigators in Kenya
