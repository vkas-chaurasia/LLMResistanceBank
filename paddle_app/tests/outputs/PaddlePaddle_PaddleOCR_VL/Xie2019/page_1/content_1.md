## Abstract

Salmonella enterica is a common foodborne pathogen responsible for major global health problems such as paratyphoid fever and gastroenteritis. Here, we report the prevalence, antibiotic resistance phenotypes, serotypes, and molecular subtyping of Salmonella isolated from eggs in Guangdong, China. Out of 1,000 egg samples, 54 (5.40%) were positive. S. Enteritidis made up the largest proportion of samples with 11 serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility test indicated that most strains were resistant to  $ \beta $ -lactam, aminoglycoside, and tetracycline antibiotics (27.00%–40.00%). There were 37 STs based on MLST typing. MLST and ERIC-PCR classified 54 isolates into three and five clusters, respectively, which revealed the genetic relatedness and diversity. In conclusion, frequent monitoring of eggs for Salmonella, antibiotic resistance profiles and genetic diversity is essential for improving food safety.

## 1 | INTRODUCTION

Salmonella enterica is a major foodborne pathogen that infects approximately 9 million people worldwide and is responsible for 155,000 deaths annually, causing serious economic losses (Huang et al., 2016; Li, Ye, et al., 2017). It is well known that this pathogen is mainly spread by unsafe handling of uncooked animal food products including egg, chicken, and pork (Gillespie, O'Brien, Adak, Ward, & Smith, 2005; Wang et al., 2012). As an important foodborne pathogen in China, Salmonella was responsible for approximately 70%–80% of foodborne pathogenic outbreaks (Wang, Zheng, & Wang, 2007). Typhoidal Salmonella causes severe and life-threatening diseases, while nontyphoidal Salmonella is associated with self-limiting diseases such as gastroenteritis, but still severe systemic infections occur in infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals (Ceyssens, Mattheus, Vanhoof, & Bertrand, 2015).

In recent decades, antimicrobial resistance has emerged and evolved in many bacterial as the excessive use of antimicrobials in human and aquaculture systems (Kang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013). The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole will further complicate the treatment and management of enteric fever (Ejaz et al., 2017). Strains that have been detected are resistant to some clinical first-line antibiotics used in the treatment of severe Salmonella infections (Boonkhot, Tadee, & Patchanee, 2015). As antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be directly transmitted through the food chain or transfer their antimicrobial resistance to human pathogens by mobile genetic elements, it is important to monitor antibiotic resistance among Salmonella isolates and control the risk.



Serotyping is a phenotypic characteristic that is a useful epidemiological marker for Salmonella. More than 2,600 serotypes have been reported (Abbott, Ni, & Janda, 2012). The prevalence of Salmonella serovars in different countries also varies over time and regions. For example, Salmonella Enteritidis is the most common serovar in
