_**Isolation and Identification**_
_**of Salmonella Strains**_

The NF U 47–100/2007 (Afnor, 2007) standard method was adopted for the isolation and the biochemical
and serological identification of _Salmonella._ The serotyping was carried out at the enterobacteria service of
the Institut Pasteur of Algeria, using _Salmonella_ antiserums anti-O and anti-H (BioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile,
France).


_**Antimicrobial Sensitivity Testing**_

The phenotypic study of the antimicrobial resistance
was performed at the Bacteriology and Antibiotherapy
Department of the Institut Pasteur of Algeria. Thirtyfour antimicrobial agents of 9 different chemical classes
were used: ampicillin (10 μg), amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid (20 μg/10 μg), mecillinam (10 μg), ticarcillin (75
μg), piperacillin (100 μg), latamoxef (30 μg), imepenem (10 μg), aztreonam (30 μg), cefazolin (30 μg), cefalexin (30 μg), cefoxitin (30 μg), ceftazidim (30 μg),
cefepim (30 μg), cefuroxim (30 μg), cefotaxim (30 μg),
to ceftiofur (30 μg), cephalotin (30 μg), gentamicin (10
μg), amikacin (30 μg), netilmicin (30 μg), kanamycin
(30 μg), isepamicin (30 μg), nitrofurantoїne (300 μg),
nalidixic acid (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), enrofloxacin (5 μg), levofloxacin (5 μg), tetracyclines (30 μg),
chloramphenicol (30 μg), sulphonamides (300 μg),
trimethoprim (5 μg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(1.25 μg/23.75 μg), colistin (10 μg), and fosfomycin
(200 μg; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Micrograms indicates
the antibiotic load in one disk; the unit of this load (expressed in micrograms) for each antibiotic used for each
bacterial species is specified by the supplier (Bio-Rad).
The minimum inhibitory concentration was established
using the E-test (AB-Biodisk). _Escherichia coli_ ATCC
25922 (Institut Pasteur Paris, Paris, France) was used
for the control antibiograms. The method adopted for
the study of the antimicrobial resistance is based on
the diffusion in Mueller-Hinton agar media as described
by Kirby-Bauer and interpreted according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2001) guidelines, which are recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO, 1999). In our study, the multiresistant strains are the ones that confer a resistance to
2 or more antimicrobials. The study of genetic support
required the use of antimicrobial powders: tetracycline
(Sigma, Woodstock, VA), nalidixic acid (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), rifampicin (Life-pharmacy, Tuen
Mun, Hong Kong, China), nitrofurantoїnes (Saïdal,
Annaba, Algeria), kanamycin (Bristol-Meyers Squibb,
New York, NY), trimethoprim (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), injectable sodic ampicillin (Biopharm, Bothell,
WA), chloramphenicol sodic ampicillin (Serva Peinbiochemica). Also, several reference strains and plasmids



were used (Institut Pasteur Paris): _Escherichia coli_
K12Nal (nalidixic acid resistance) and _Escherichia coli_
C600Rif (rifampicin resistance) for the plasmid transfer by conjugation and Com1 (K) Rif, Com1 PPED
178 (ACTp) Rif, F1me PPED 181/4(T) Nal, and F1me
PPED 181/3(CTp) Rif for the compatibility test, as
well as the DNA of the λ phage digested by the Hind
III enzyme as a reference to determine the size of the
plasmids. The genetic transfer by conjugation that
was used for the detection of plasmids carrying the resistance characters was described by Courvalin et al.
(1985). After streaking on agar bromocresol purple and
18 to 24 h of incubation at 35°C, a colony of the studied
donor strain and that of the recipient reference strain
were individually inoculated in buffered glucose broth.
After shaking for 4 h in a water bath at 35°C, 1 mL of
each culture was mixed with a rake on Mueller-Hinton
agar and incubated for 18 h at 35°C. One milliliter of
buffered glucose broth was added, and then the supernatant was recovered after mixing. Moreover, 1 mL of
an antibiotic for the suspected plasmidic character for
the donor strain and 1 mL of another antibiotic for
the suspected chromosomal character for the receiving
strain were added to 18 mL of Mueller-Hinton agar.
The final concentrations of the antibiotics used are Furans, 300 μg/mL; TCY, 33 μg/mL; ampicillin, 200 μg/
mL; kanamycine, 25 μg/mL; Nal, 100 μg/mL; TMP, 20
μg/mL; CCC, 25 μg/mL. A quarter of a Petri dish was
seeded in lines by the 2 strains and the 3/4 remaining
were streaked by the supernatant (mixture of these 2
strains). After 18 h of incubation at 35°C, the appearance of colonies on the part inoculated with the supernatant indicates the presence of the transconjugants.
The resulting transconjugants were tested to determine their resistance profiles and therefore their transferable characteristics. To determine the major incompatibility groups of plasmids the used test was the same
as for the genetic transfer; it required a cross between
a transconjugant and _E. coli_ carrying a plasmid reference. The plasmids were extracted from the transferred
strains and their transconjugants, using the alkaline
lyse technique (Kado and Liu, 1981), and the plasmid
profiles were determined by separating the plasmids extracted on agarose gel.


**RESULTS**

Nineteen percent of the total samples were positive
for _Salmonella_ . The distribution of _Salmonella_ per wilaya showed 48% of cases from Bouira, 21% from Bejaïa,
16% from Boumerdes, and 15% from Tizi-Ouzou. Thirteen different serotypes were identified, among which
_Salmonella_ Heidelberg was the most prevalent (24%).
_Salmonella_ Heidelberg, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, _Salmo-_
_nella_ Albany, _Salmonella_ Infantis, _Salmonella_ Blockley, and _Salmonella_ Livingstone were present in all the
wilayas. Besides, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis prevailed in
Bouira, _Salmonella_ Albany in Bejaïa and Tizi-Ouzou,
and _Salmonella_ Heidelberg in Boumerdes (Table 1).
