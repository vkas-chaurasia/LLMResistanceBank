Deresse Daka [1*], Solomon G/silassie [2] and Dawit Yihdego [1]


Abstract


Background: Quarter milk samples from cows were examined to determine the prevalence of Staphylococcus
aureus (SA) and different antibiotic resistant pattern were determined in a cross-sectional study design.
Objective: The objective of this study was to isolate Staphylococcus aureus from samples of cow’s milk obtained
from Hawassa area and to determine their antibiotic susceptibility patterns.


Method: A total of 160 milk (CCP1-CCP5) samples were collected and screened for the presence of S. aureus. Gram
staining, oxidase, catalase, DNase, haemolysis and coagulase tests were employed for bacterial identification.


Results: All the samples were contaminated with S. aureus. A total of 78 S. aureus isolates were obtained during this
study. The levels of contamination with S. aureus were higher in milk obtained from CCP1, CCP2, CCP3, CCP4 and
CCP5 at Hawassa area farms (18.0%, 25.6%, 27.0%, 21.8% and 7.7%) respectively. A large percentage of the S. aureus
isolates (25.6% and 27.0%) were from CCP2 and CCP3. All strains were resistant to Penicillin G (PG) (10 μg), Ampicillin
(AP) (10 μg), Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid (AC) (30 μg), Ciprofloxacin (CIP) (5 μg), Erythromycin (E) (15 μg), Ceftriaxone
(CRO) (30 μg), Trimethoprime-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) (25 μg) Oxacillin (Ox) (1 μg) and Vancomycin (V) (30 μg),
67.9%, 70.9%, 30.9%, 0%, 32.1%, 23.1%, 7.7%, 60.3% and 38.5% respectively.


Conclusion: The proportion of isolates resistant to CIP, TMP-SMZ, CRO, AC, E and V were low compared to AP, PG and
Ox. S. aureus is normally resident in humans; therefore, the S. aureus present in the cow’s milk may have resulted from
transmission between the two species, emphasizing the need to improve sanitary conditions in the milking
environment.

Introduction
Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous human pathogen
and a common cause of invasive and life threatening
infections. It is the most common cause of communityassociated cellulitis [1,2] endocarditis [3], and is a common cause of bacteremia [1,4,5]. S. aureus strains were
once nearly uniformly susceptible to semi-synthetic
penicillinase-resistant β-lactams (e.g. methicillin, oxacillin), the most commonly used class of antibiotics
for skin infection. These strains were termed ‘methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a term that



implied cross-resistance to all β-lactams including all
penicillins and cephalosporins.

personnel. It could also result from micro-organisms
that enter the udder through the teat opening canal [10].
Antibiotic-resistant S. aureus isolates pose a severe
challenge to both veterinary and health professions
and dairy cattle producers because they have a negative impact on therapy [11,12]. The usage of antibiotics
correlates with the emergence and maintenance of
antibiotic-resistant traits within pathogenic strains [13].
These traits are coded for by particular genes that may
be carried on the bacterial chromosome, plasmids,
transposons or on gene cassettes that are incorporated
into integrons [14], thus are easily transferred among
isolates. Multiple antibiotic resistant S. aureus strains
have been isolated from milk obtained from cattle,
beef and human samples in many parts of the world

[13,15-18]. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance usually varies between isolates from the different sampled
stations and even between isolates from different herds
on the same farm [16].
Determination of levels of S. aureus and an evaluation
of the antibiotic-resistant phenotypes of the isolates
could serve as a tool for determining the hygiene standards implemented during milking. Data on antibiotic
resistance could also be used to characterize these opportunistic pathogens, which may further limit the risks
associated with the consumption of contaminated milk
and its products [19]. The aim of this study was to isolate S. aureus from milk obtained from farm level collected milk and further characterization of their
susceptibility patterns to nine selected antibiotics.


Methods and materials
Area of the study and collection of samples
A cross-sectional study design was used to determine
the bacteriological analysis of cow milk in Hawassa
town from August 2011-January 2012. A total of 160
milk samples (five samples per family from different
HACCP levels) were collected. The study on antibiotic
resistance of S. aureus isolation was included 32
families of the farms. All of these farms were Hybrid
Holland breed herd with average age of 7 years old. An
average herd size of the farm was 10 in number and a
milking technique of the study community was manual.
These farms are situated in the Southern part of
Ethiopia at 250 km far apart from the capital city of
the country.
Samples of approximately 10 mL of fresh milk were
collected from different critical control points (CCP1CCP5) using sterile sample collection bottles. The samples were immediately transported on ice to the Medical
Microbiology Laboratory of the Hawassa University –
Referral Hospital for analysis. Upon arrival in the Laboratory, samples were analyzed immediately.



Isolation of presumptive S. aureus from milk samples
Ten-fold serial dilutions were performed using 2% peptone
water and aliquots of 100 μL from each dilution were
spread plated onto mannitol salt agar (MSA) (Supplied by
Oxoid Company). The plates were incubated aerobically at
37°C for 18 h – 24 h. Consequently, the 78 characteristic S.
aureus colonies that were yellow in color from each MSA
plate were further purified by sub-culturing onto MSA
plates and the plates were incubated aerobically at 37°C
for 18 h–24 h. These isolates were retained for further
bacterial identification.


Bacterial identification
Gram staining was performed [20] and Gram-positive
cocci that occurred in clusters under the microscope
were subjected to preliminary biochemical tests (the
catalase and oxidase tests). The identities of the isolates
were confirmed based on positive results for the DNase
test, beta-haemolytic patterns on blood agar enriched
with 5% (v/v) sheep blood and the coagulase slide test
for S. aureus using the (PROLD Diagnostics, Canada).
The slide agglutination test was performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells from a pure
colony were placed on the clean area of the slide using a
sterile toothpick and a drop of the PROLD reagent was
added. These were mixed using the toothpick and the
isolates were identified based on the formation of agglutination. An isolates that formed agglutination were
recorded as S. aureus and maintained at 4°C in 30%
glycerol for further characterization by antibiotic susceptibility testing.


Antibiotic susceptibility
Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on all S.
aureus isolates to determine their antibiotic-resistance
profiles [21]. Fresh overnight cultures were prepared and
used for antibiotic sensitivity tests. An aliquot (100 μL)
from each isolate suspension was spread plated on
Mueller Hinton agar (supplied by Oxoid Company). Susceptibilities of the isolates to a panel of nine different
antibiotic discs (6 μm in diameter, Mast group LTD
MERSEY SIDE, UK) were determined. The antibiotics
tested in this study were mostly developed resistant by
bacteria as documented in South Africa [22,23]. Antibiotic discs were gently pressed onto the inoculated
Mueller Hinton agar to ensure intimate contact with the
surface and the plates were incubated aerobically at 37°C
for 18 h – 24 h [24]. Inhibition zone diameters were measured and values obtained from the National Committee
on Clinical Laboratory Standards [24] were used to interpret the results obtained. S. aureus isolates were then
classified as resistant, intermediate resistant or susceptible
to a particular antibiotic. Multiple antibiotic resistant

(MAR) phenotypes were recorded for isolates showing
resistance to three and more antibiotics [25].


Results
Prevalence of S. aureus in tested milk samples
A total of 160 milk samples (32 per HACCP level) were
analyzed and were 78 positive for S. aureus (Table 1). A
total of 210 potential isolates were sub-cultured and further analyzed. However, only 78 isolates satisfied all the
identification criteria and were used for subsequent analysis. These constituted a total of 78 S. aureus isolates
(Table 1). S. aureus was obtained from each of the 32
different critical control point (CCP) samples taken per
HACCP level, giving a prevalence of S. aureus of 48.75%
for the 160 samples. The results demonstrated the presence of S. aureus in all the milk samples, regardless of
the farm setting. However, the levels of contamination
with S. aureus were higher in milk samples obtained in
this study area (Table 1).


Antibiotic susceptibility
All 78 S. aureus isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility tests. Nine antimicrobial agents, from different antibiotic classes were used. Some were selected
because some studies have shown that large numbers of
bacteria were resistant to them [22,23]. Antibiotics of
veterinary and human health relevance were also considered. A summary of the percentage of S. aureus that
were resistant to these antibiotics is provided in Table 2.
A large proportion of the isolates of this study area
were resistant to Ampicillin (10 μg), Penicillin G (10 μg),
and Oxacillin (1 μg), while a similarly large proportion of
those from the transportation container were resistant
to, Ampicillin (10 μg), penicillin G (10 μg), Erythromycin,
(15 μg), Ceftriaxone (10 μg), Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid

Hawassa area, South Ethiopia



(30 μg), and Oxacillin (1 μg). There were no resistant
groups for Ciprofloxacin (5 μg) antibiotics.
In general observation the large percentage of Penicillin G (10 μg), Ampicillin (10 μg) and Oxacillin (1 μg) resistant S. aureus were isolated from the study area.
These were also resistant to several other antibiotics.
Therefore, one can easily conclude that these are Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
Only a small proportion of the isolates from the
teat, bucket and storage container were resistant to
Trimethoprime-Sulfamethoxazole (25 μg); Erythromycin
(15 μg); Ceftriaxone (30 μg) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic
Acid (30 μg). None of the isolates from bucket, storage
container and freshly pasteurized milk were resistant to
TMP-SMX (25 μg). Furthermore, 23.5-70% of the isolates
from the sample were resistant to Vancomycin (30 μg),
while 15-100% of those isolated was resistant to Oxacillin
(1 μg).


MAR phenotypes of S. aureus
Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotypes were
determined for S. aureus (Table 3). The predominant
MAR phenotypes for S. aureus isolated from this study
area were PG-AP-AC-E-CRO-Ox and PG-AP-Ox in
19.2% and 20.5% of the isolates, respectively. Furthermore, MAR phenotypes PG-AP-AC-TMX-Ox-VA,
PG-AP-AC-E-TMX-Ox-VA and PG-AP-TMX-Ox were
obtained in 1.3% of the isolates. The MAR phenotypes
PG-AP-AC-E-TMX-Ox, PG-AP-AC-E-CRO-Ox-VA and
PG-AP-E were obtained in 1.3% of the isolates. Also PGAP-AC-E-Ox-VA 3.8% and PG-AP-Ox-VA 7.7% were the
MAR phenotypes for S. aureus isolated from this study
area (Table 3).
It is thus evident that MAR S. aureus was isolated
from all CCP. However, among the isolates from this
study area 62.8% of the isolates develop MAR. Among
all MAR phenotypes of S. aureus, 42.9% of them were
resistance to six different antibiotics and 6.1% were resistance to seven antibiotics. Fifty one percent (51%) of
them were resistance to 3 or 4 antibiotics.


Discussion
In this study we described the isolation and antibiotic
susceptibility characterization of S. aureus from milk
obtained from five different CCP levels. Our results
indicate that 40.6% of the samples were positive for S.
aureus and that more of these bacteria were positively
identified from milk samples. Several studies have been
conducted in South Africa to evaluate the prevalence of
S. aureus in milk [13,26,27]. The results reported in our
study were similarly high when compared to those studies [13,27]. Although the prevalence of S. aureus has
been reported to vary with the size and geographic region of the area sampled, a high proportion of these

bacteria in milk relates to poor hygiene practices. Based
on observations made during the collection of samples,
we therefore report that improper hygiene and poor
farm management practices contributed to the presence
of S. aureus in the milk, especially in those from the
Hawassa area. In this study area milk was obtained from
animals by washing their hands and/or the utensils and
containers used. In certain cases, untreated groundwater
was used to wash the containers that were used for milking. This may have contributed to the high level of S.
aureus isolated. Improving the hygienic conditions of
the milking environment and/or utensils may reduce the
prevalence of S. aureus in milk and prevent its transmission to humans.
A further objective of the study was to characterize
and compare the antibiotic-resistance profiles of S. aureus
isolated from the study area. The motivation for this was
the fact that there were no clear studies conducted in the
area. Furthermore, the presence of antibiotic-resistant
S. aureus has been reported to negatively affect the

treatment of its associated infections in humans and
animals [12,15,23]. We therefore believe that an investigation of the antibiotic-resistance profiles of these
isolates may serve as a tool in assessing both the
sanitary conditions employed during milking and the
health risks that humans may encounter when infected
by antibiotic-resistant strains.
PG (10 μg), AP (10 μg) and Ox (1 μg) were the drugs
to which a large proportion of the isolates were resistant
(Table 4). As shown in Table 4, between 60.0% and
67.9% of the isolates from all CCP levels were resistant
to these three drugs. Also VA (30 μg), AC (30 μg), E
(15 μg) and CRO (30 μg) were resistance to S. aureus
about 38.5%, 32.1%, 30.8% and 23.5% respectively. None
of the S. aureus were resistance to CIP (5 μg). However,
very small proportions of S. aureus were resistance to
TMP-SMX (25 μg) (7.7%). Contrarily to our observations,
a study reported that larger percentage (15.7% to 19%) of
S. aureus isolated was resistant to TMP-SMX (25 μg)

[28]. The finding that a large number of S. aureus were
resistant to PG (10 μg), AP (10 μg) and Ox (1 μg) is, however, a cause for concern and should be further investigated. It is thus our view that the results obtained in this
study do not accurately reflect the usage of this antibiotic
on farms. We cannot explain this phenomenon.
CIP (5 μg) resistance was almost non-existent in the all
CCP levels of the isolates. Also no resistance S. aureus
strain was isolated from immediate pasteurized milk for
AC (30 μg), E (15 μg), CRO (30 μg), TMP-SMX (25 μg)
and CIP (5 μg). Despite the fact that a significantly larger

number of S. aureus isolated from immediate pasteurized milk was resistant to PG (10 μg), AP (10 μg), Ox
(1 μg) and V (30 μg), it was evident from our results that
this antibiotic is not frequently used in animals by largescale farmers. Contrarily to our observations, a study
reported in South Africa, was 100% of the isolates from
the two commercial farms were susceptible to Vancomycin [28]. This drug is no longer used in veterinary
medicine in many countries [29] including South Africa,
which may account for the results reported here.
Small proportions (67.8%) of the isolates from this
study area were resistant to the beta-lactam penicillin G
(10 μg), when compared to the isolates from the communal farms, in which 69% to 98% were resistant [28]. The
antibiotic resistance obtained for S. aureus isolated from
does not correlate with the extensive usage of Penicillin
on dairy cattle farms in Hawassa town. The Ampicillinresistance pattern for isolates from these all levels of
CCP were similar to the Penicillin G (10 μg) resistance
pattern, thus a smaller proportion of the isolates were
resistant to this drug when compared to the isolates
from the South Africa. Ampicillin (10 μg) is also commonly used on dairy cattle farms in the study area. Resistance to Penicillin G (10 μg) is thus used as a marker
to assess the susceptibility of S. aureus isolates against
other beta-lactam antibiotics [16,29]. This correlates
with our findings but suggests that further studies need
to be conducted to determine the exact inter-relation
between these drugs in the expression of antibioticresistant phenotypes on dairy cattle farms in Ethiopia.
The Methicillin-resistance pattern had a similar trend
to that of several of the previously discussed antibiotics.
This is because larger numbers of Oxacillin (10 μg)resistant isolates were obtained from the milk in this
study area.
What is of concern is the large number of Oxacillin
(10 μg) (60.3%) that were isolated from the Study area.
This is an indicator of MRSA. High levels of MRSA have
been identified in patients in the United States and some
European countries [30]. In these countries, 44.4%,
34.7%, 41.8% and 32.4% of isolates from patients in the
United States, France, Italy and Spain, respectively, were
resistant to Methicillin. These levels, however, are lower
than those in our study. Methicillin is not used on dairy
cattle farms in the South Ethiopia. However, Methicillin
resistance could be explained by the inter-relationship
between beta-lactam resistance and resistance to this
drug. In MRSA, Methicillin resistance is conferred by
the Penicillin binding protein (PBP) 2a that is encoded
for by the mecA gene [31]. PBP2a does not readily bind
the beta-lactam moiety. However, in MRSA that are
exposed to beta-lactam antibiotics, this PBP2a would
contribute to the resistance by providing transpeptidase
activity to the native PBPs during cell wall synthesis. In



our study, the resistant phenotype PG-AP-Ox was frequently identified usually with the addition of one or
more antibiotics (Table 3). It is thus recommended that
future studies should confirm the presence of the mecA
gene in observed MRSA due to these β-lactamase
antibiotics.
It has also been documented that MRSA isolates that
are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics may develop
induced resistance to Vancomycin (30 μg) [31]. All the
isolates from the study area were resistant to Oxacillin
(1 μg) were also resistant to penicillin G (10 μg) and
Ampicilin (10 μg). In addition, all PG, AP, and AC antibiotic resistance S. aureus were also resistance to Ox
antibiotics. Moreover, 26.5% of the Oxacillin resistances
S. aureus were also resistance to Vancomycin (30 μg).
We therefore suggest that this may account for the identification of Vancomycin-resistant isolates in the study
because Vancomycin is not used in either veterinary or
human medicine in the area [29]. Moreover, betalactam-induced Vancomycin-resistant MRSA are not
easily detected by conventional antibiotic susceptibility
tests [32] and this may also account for the very low
proportion of Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus observed.
The MAR phenotypes (Table 3) obtained in the study
correlated with the percentage of antibiotic resistance.
Although the development of resistance to a particular
antibiotic depends on the level of exposure to the antimicrobials, [14] there are many other factors that are
involved. We are therefore suggesting that molecular
methods be used to characterize these isolates for the
presence of antibiotic-resistance determinants, which
may provide data to support our conclusions.
S. aureus is normally resident in humans; therefore the
S. aureus present in the cow’s milk may have resulted
from transmission from humans, which raises questions
regarding the hygiene practices followed.


Conclusion and recommendation
S. aureus was isolated from all milk samples from
Southern Ethiopia. A large proportion of the isolates
obtained were resistant to three or more antibiotics.
These were also resistant to Vancomycin (30 μg). This
was particularly the case in the public setting and is
cause for concern. The high level of MAR S. aureus
and the implications thereof warrant further investigation. One of the aspects that need to be investigated is
the cause of the observed resistance phenotypes. Furthermore, impacts and dynamics of genetic antibiotic
determinants should also be investigated using molecular methods.
