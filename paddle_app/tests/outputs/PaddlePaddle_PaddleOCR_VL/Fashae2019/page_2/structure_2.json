Decades ago, a study reported the important role of S. Typhi and NTS in septicemia in humans in Ibadan, Nigeria; however, the specific NTS serotypes [17] were not revealed, probably due to the lack of resources and high-quality antisera that are often lacking from many African countries [18]. Chicken is an important food source to man; chicken meat dishes are special delicacies, particularly during festive periods in Nigeria, but the poultry industry is largely unregulated. The link between human salmonellosis and consumption of chicken is not known nor is the prevalence of the serovars in Nigeria. A previous study found the prevalence of S. Enteritidis in chicken meat in Maiduguri, Nigeria, to be 27% [19]. A recent study from Maiduguri, in the northern part of Nigeria, reported S. Hiduddify to be the predominant serovar in free-range chickens and poultry meat [20].",
