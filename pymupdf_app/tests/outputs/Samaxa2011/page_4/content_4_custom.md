were avenues for Salmonella cross-contamination and that
the composition of the bacterial flora on meat at retail
outlets was a reflection of the contamination introduced
during slaughtering.

The PCR assay and the conventional culture method
were used in parallel, and the results revealed that the PCR
method was more rapid and sensitive for detection of
Salmonella. However, one of the limitations of PCR-based
methods for detection of pathogens from various food
matrices has been the inhibition of the Taq polymerase by
the food components (15, 23). The blood and fats present in
the raw meat sausages utilized in this study could have caused
PCR inhibition. Another constraint of PCR is that remnants
of DNA from dead bacterial cells can serve as a template for
PCR long after cell viability has been lost (2, 23), making it
possible to obtain false-positive results. These deficiencies
have reduced the usefulness of PCR methods for routine
monitoring in food microbiology laboratories, where injured
or nonviable cells are generally present even after the stress
induced by food processing and preservation. However, the
PCR method utilized in the present study did not have these
problems because, as duly noted by Bansal et al. (4) and
Piknova et al. (20), the enrichment steps (1:1,000 dilution)
that allow proliferation of the target organism also dilute PCR
inhibitors, thereby ensuring the detection of only viable
bacteria, without inhibition by meat components. When the
results for PCR assay and the conventional culture method
were not in agreement, the results were verified by repeating
both tests, and in all the cases the subsequent results of the
conventional culture method conformed to that of the PCR
method.

Although all Salmonella serotypes are thought to have
the potential to cause disease in humans, some serotypes
have more clinical significance (14). An annual list of

DISCUSSION


In this study, beef and pork sausages had the highest
total viable bacterial counts; more than half of the samples
had counts above the Food and Agriculture Organization
recommended limit of 1 | 10 [6] CFU/g (10). The results for
beef sausages were similar to those obtained by Odumeru
and Belvedere (19), who found total viable bacterial counts
of 10 [2] to 10 [8] CFU/g in ground beef, with 72% of the
samples above the recommended limit. A high total viable
bacterial count may be an indication of poor sanitation or
problems with processing control or ingredients. Sausages
are derived from a variety of meat cuts, which are ground
and manipulated several times during processing; as a result,
high microbial counts were expected.

Mutton sausages had the highest microbiological
quality, i.e., low culturable microorganism counts, and the
least amount of contamination with Salmonella, making
them a better choice for human consumption. In contrast,
chicken sausages had lower aerobic mesophilic bacterial
counts than did beef and pork sausages but had the highest
incidence of Salmonella. This result was expected because
poultry is a principal reservoir for Salmonella (21). These
results clearly indicate that aerobic bacterial counts provide
information on the extent of sanitary quality but cannot
assure the safety of the product with respect to the presence
of pathogens. However, the incidence of Salmonella in the
four types of sausage was not significantly different. For
example, even though the prevalence of Salmonella was
most disparate in chicken and mutton, this difference was
not statistically significant.

In this study, the prevalence of Salmonella was 25.3%
in beef sausages, similar to the 26% prevalence reported in
an earlier study of Salmonella in beef sausages carried out
by Mrema et al. (17). In that study, Salmonella prevalence
was determined only for beef sausages. Similar prevalences
(23 and 28%) were reported for two abattoir environments
by Motsoela et al. (16), who inferred that environments in
meat-cutting rooms of abattoirs, butchers, and supermarkets
