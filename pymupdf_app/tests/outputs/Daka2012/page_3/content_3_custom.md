(MAR) phenotypes were recorded for isolates showing
resistance to three and more antibiotics [25].


Results
Prevalence of S. aureus in tested milk samples
A total of 160 milk samples (32 per HACCP level) were
analyzed and were 78 positive for S. aureus (Table 1). A
total of 210 potential isolates were sub-cultured and further analyzed. However, only 78 isolates satisfied all the
identification criteria and were used for subsequent analysis. These constituted a total of 78 S. aureus isolates
(Table 1). S. aureus was obtained from each of the 32
different critical control point (CCP) samples taken per
HACCP level, giving a prevalence of S. aureus of 48.75%
for the 160 samples. The results demonstrated the presence of S. aureus in all the milk samples, regardless of
the farm setting. However, the levels of contamination
with S. aureus were higher in milk samples obtained in
this study area (Table 1).


Antibiotic susceptibility
All 78 S. aureus isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility tests. Nine antimicrobial agents, from different antibiotic classes were used. Some were selected
because some studies have shown that large numbers of
bacteria were resistant to them [22,23]. Antibiotics of
veterinary and human health relevance were also considered. A summary of the percentage of S. aureus that
were resistant to these antibiotics is provided in Table 2.
A large proportion of the isolates of this study area
were resistant to Ampicillin (10 μg), Penicillin G (10 μg),
and Oxacillin (1 μg), while a similarly large proportion of
those from the transportation container were resistant
to, Ampicillin (10 μg), penicillin G (10 μg), Erythromycin,
(15 μg), Ceftriaxone (10 μg), Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid

(30 μg), and Oxacillin (1 μg). There were no resistant
groups for Ciprofloxacin (5 μg) antibiotics.
In general observation the large percentage of Penicillin G (10 μg), Ampicillin (10 μg) and Oxacillin (1 μg) resistant S. aureus were isolated from the study area.
These were also resistant to several other antibiotics.
Therefore, one can easily conclude that these are Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
Only a small proportion of the isolates from the
teat, bucket and storage container were resistant to
Trimethoprime-Sulfamethoxazole (25 μg); Erythromycin
(15 μg); Ceftriaxone (30 μg) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic
Acid (30 μg). None of the isolates from bucket, storage
container and freshly pasteurized milk were resistant to
TMP-SMX (25 μg). Furthermore, 23.5-70% of the isolates
from the sample were resistant to Vancomycin (30 μg),
while 15-100% of those isolated was resistant to Oxacillin
(1 μg).


MAR phenotypes of S. aureus
Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotypes were
determined for S. aureus (Table 3). The predominant
MAR phenotypes for S. aureus isolated from this study
area were PG-AP-AC-E-CRO-Ox and PG-AP-Ox in
19.2% and 20.5% of the isolates, respectively. Furthermore, MAR phenotypes PG-AP-AC-TMX-Ox-VA,
PG-AP-AC-E-TMX-Ox-VA and PG-AP-TMX-Ox were
obtained in 1.3% of the isolates. The MAR phenotypes
PG-AP-AC-E-TMX-Ox, PG-AP-AC-E-CRO-Ox-VA and
PG-AP-E were obtained in 1.3% of the isolates. Also PGAP-AC-E-Ox-VA 3.8% and PG-AP-Ox-VA 7.7% were the
MAR phenotypes for S. aureus isolated from this study
area (Table 3).
It is thus evident that MAR S. aureus was isolated
from all CCP. However, among the isolates from this
study area 62.8% of the isolates develop MAR. Among
all MAR phenotypes of S. aureus, 42.9% of them were
resistance to six different antibiotics and 6.1% were resistance to seven antibiotics. Fifty one percent (51%) of
them were resistance to 3 or 4 antibiotics.


Discussion
In this study we described the isolation and antibiotic
susceptibility characterization of S. aureus from milk
obtained from five different CCP levels. Our results
indicate that 40.6% of the samples were positive for S.
aureus and that more of these bacteria were positively
identified from milk samples. Several studies have been
conducted in South Africa to evaluate the prevalence of
S. aureus in milk [13,26,27]. The results reported in our
study were similarly high when compared to those studies [13,27]. Although the prevalence of S. aureus has
been reported to vary with the size and geographic region of the area sampled, a high proportion of these
