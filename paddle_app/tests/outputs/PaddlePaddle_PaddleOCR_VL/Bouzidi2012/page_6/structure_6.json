In the current study, seven Salmonella isolates were found to be resistant to tetracycline and streptomycin. Resistance to these antimicrobials is commonly observed among Salmonella isolates and has been reported by several studies in poultry products (Manie, Khan, Brozel, Veith, & Gouws, 1998; Nayak et al., 2004). In the present study, resistance to nalidixic acid was detected in twelve isolates belonging to five serotypes, and resistance to ciprofloxacin was only detected in three isolates of S. Kentucky with  $ MIC \\geq 8 \\, mg/L $ . The presence of isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones is more worrying, as this class of antimicrobials is often used to treat severe human salmonellosis. To our knowledge, this is the first isolation of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Kentucky in Algeria, but no investigation has been conducted to identify the source of contamination. This coincides with findings of similar ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of S. Kentucky isolated by the Pasteur Institute in Paris at the same time and related to travelers returning from northeast and eastern Africa (Le Hello et al., 2010). In poultry, this ciprofloxacin resistant Kentucky clone was isolated from chickens and turkeys in three noncontiguous African countries (Ethiopia, Morocco, and Togo), suggesting that poultry may be an important vehicle for infection by this strain (Le Hello et al., 2010). A possible source of contamination of African poultry could be the aquaculture farms in the North–East or East of Africa, as they use antimicrobial agents intensively. This ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Kentucky clone may have spread to poultry through fish meal feeds originating from these aquaculture farms. In our investigation, the antimicrobial resistance tests revealed a resistance to cephalotin in five isolates from two serotypes, S. Hadar and S. Kentucky. No isolate resistant to third-generation cephalosporin has been isolated, unlike human isolates from these regions (data not shown) that showed a considerable increase in resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in hospitals.",

The persistence of Salmonella contamination between two successive flocks housed in the same building was probably a consequence of this ineffective cleaning procedure. Research on broiler chickens (Baggesen, Olsen, & Bisgaard, 1992; Lahellec et al., 1986) has demonstrated that ineffective cleaning and disinfection could be the predominant risk factor of Salmonella contamination.",

For the farms evaluated in this study, four out of five henhouses where numerous flies were observed inside the layer houses during sampling visits tested positive for Salmonella. This observation underlines the importance of biosecurity measures to protect birds from infections and their dissemination. It is also in agreement with previous studies (Craven et al., 2000; Hoover, Kenney, Amick, & Hypes, 1997; Liljebjelke et al., 2005).",

It may be indirectly an evidence of a potential link between high temperature inside the henhouses, due to the poor ventilation, and the presence of Salmonella. In the current study, 16 henhouses were ventilated naturally by windows and doors, and only two featured a mechanical ventilation system. Of the five henhouses where there were not enough windows and where air renewal was insufficient and the temperature high ( $ >30\\ ^{\\circ}C $ ), four were contaminated (80% vs 30.8%). The lack of fresh air circulating inside the henhouse leads to high inside temperatures, especially in summer. High temperatures can cause agitation and stress in hens, which can subsequently lead to Salmonella excretion. Stress has already been shown to have an immunosuppressive effect in laying hens (El-Lethey, Huber-Eicher, & Jungi, 2003; Humphrey, 2006), with possible negative consequences on Salmonella shedding.",

In our study, rodents inside the layer house may be a risk factor because they can act as vectors for Salmonella. The number of flocks studied is too small to confirm this tendency. However, studies carried out on broiler chickens and laying-hen flocks identified rodents as a potential source of Salmonella contamination and persistence in poultry houses (Henzler, Ebel, Sanders, Kradel, & Mason, 1994; Henzler & Opitz, 1992).",

The results of this study also illustrate that, despite using an extended sampling protocol on flock (3 pooled feces samples, 2 pools of dust and environmental swabs, 2 pools of water and feed samples), the proportion of positive samples remains very low (19/2754). We also revealed the presence of multiple Salmonella serovars, and a small proportion of antibiotic-resistant isolates, which may suggest a moderate use of antibiotics in Algerian laying-hen flocks.
