ABSTRACT
Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and antibiotic resistance profile of
Salmonella enterica isolated from raw beef, mutton and intestines sold in Ouagadougou; Burkina Faso.
Methodology and Results: A total of 450 samples from raw meat of beef (n=175), mutton (n=175), beef intestine
(n=50) and sheep intestine (n=50) were analyzed using standards microbiological method for the detection of
Salmonella. The isolates were tested for antibacterial resistance using the agar diffusion method with fourteen
commonly used antibiotics. In this study, Salmonella contaminated 19% (86/450) of the samples with 27%
(47/175) of beef, 18% (9/50) of beef intestine, 11% (19/175) of mutton and 22% (11/50) of sheep intestine.
Salmonella strains isolates were most resistant to tetracycline and cefalotin than other tested antibiotics.
Conclusion and main findings: The high rate of Salmonella strains in animals can pose a major public health
risk in Burkina Faso. In addition, the susceptibility test confirms the circulation of antibiotic resistant pathogens
in raw meat. Interestingly, these findings indicate a presence of multiresistant strains. The regulation of
antibiotics use in animal husbandry is recommended to prevent antibiotic resistance in humans.
Key words: Beef, Mutton, Raw Intestine, Salmonella, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, Burkina Faso.

in different fields. The resistance to tetracycline obtained
is higher than those reported in Ethiopia, Sudan and
China in raw meats (Tassew et al., 2010; Fadlalla et al.,
2012; Li et al., 2013). In this study, results on intestines
strains are similar with the study done in Ivory Coast,
Nigeria and Iran (Coulibaly et al., 2010; Iroha et al., 2011;
Sodagari et al., 2015). This suggests a potential health
risk due to consumption of meat. Such risks can be
minimized by avoiding poor handling and raising the
awareness of food handlers. The results of this study
have disclosed two public health problems; the presence
of resistant Salmonella strains in the possibility of
Salmonella human infections through the consumption of
contaminated food, and the isolation of antibiotic-resistant
strains might suggest the use of drugs in that animal’s
environment. The occurrence of antibiotic resistant strains
of a number of pathogenic bacteria especially Salmonella
in foods has caused great concern in relation to public
health (Carlvalho et al., 2013). While the antibiotics use
has been proven an effective means for the prevention
and control of Salmonella infection, their abusive use can
have adverse consequences by promoting the selection
and prevalence of drug resistant microbial populations (Li



et al., 2013; Makka et al., 2014; Sodagari et al., 2015).
Continuous and improper use of this antibiotic may
increase resistance of antibiotics, thereby compromising
human food safety and creating a difficulty in treating
human salmonellosis (Sodagari et al., 2015). The
problem may be due to the natural resistance of species
to certain antibiotics, possible transfer of antibiotic
resistance among species and the use of sub-therapeutic
doses of antibiotics in animal feeds to improve animal
productivity, which could also select for resistant strains
(EFSA, 2012; Sambe-Ba et al., 2013). This practice leads
into a possibility that bacterial resistance developing in
the animals or food animals’ transfers to the human
population thus posing a risk for public health by
spreading of the resistance (Kagambèga et al., 2013). In
Burkina Faso, the irrational use of antibiotics in animal
husbandry is considered a major cause of increased
Salmonella resistance. Furthermore, unlimited access to
these agents without a prescription or under veterinary
control may be additional reasons for the high level of
resistance. Therefore, surveillance of antimicrobial
resistance should be done on food-borne pathogens.



CONCLUSION
This study show the degree of contamination by
salmonella enterica in raw meat sold in the open market
