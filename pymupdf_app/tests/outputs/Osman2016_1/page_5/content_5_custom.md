important antimicrobials was also observed. The antimicrobial
resistance profile of the 50 isolated Staphylococcus spp to
different antibiotics was analyzed; none of the isolates were
totally sensitive to the 12 tested antibiotics and 16/50 of the
isolates were shown to be resistant to at least 3 antibiotics
(S. lugdunensis) representing three classes. A small percentage of
the isolates (less than 50%) demonstrated resistance to oxacillin,
methicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin,
vancomycine, and tetracycline ( **Table 2** ). Also resistant to βlactams, such as ampicillin (6/50), penicillin (22/50), methicillin
(8/50), and oxacillin (13/50) was evident ( **Table 2** ). Forty
seven out of the fifty isolates were resistant to penicillin and
tetracycline.

Methicillin resistance in CPS and CNS was calculated to
be 64.3 and 52.8%, respectively. The antimicrobial resistance
patterns of the isolates are shown in **Table 3** . The resistance
ratios to clindamycin, methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, and
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in CPS and to clindamycin,
gentamycin, methicillin, oxacillin and penicillin in CNS were
found to be higher in the methicillin-resistant isolates compared
to those that were susceptible to methicillin (p < 0.001). The
lowest resistance ratio in the methicillin—resistant staphylococci
was detected for ciprofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam in
the CPS and to ampicillin-sulbactam, chloramphenicol and

ciprofloxacin in the CNS. A comparison of the resistance patterns
revealed that all isolates from chickens showed resistance from
three to nine classes of antimicrobial agents ( **Table 4** ).
Eight isolates showed resistance to oxacillin, undetectable by
mecA amplification. The three S. aureus isolates were resistant to
9–10 antimicrobials ( **Table 4** ). Two unique susceptibility profiles
were identified among the S. aureus isolates, with many resistant
