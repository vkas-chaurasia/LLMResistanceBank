nitrofurantoin. Looking at individual antimicrobials, resistance to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim
was frequently observed, followed by ampicillin, amoxicillin,
gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and nitrofurantoin. Two isolates
(20%) exhibited resistance to one antimicrobial, while eight
(80%) were resistant to two or more tested antimicrobials
(Table 4). In general, antimicrobial susceptibility test revealed
that ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and nalidixic acid were the
antimicrobials indicated as active against _Salmonella_ spp.
isolated from this study.


**4. Discussion**


In the present study, the prevalence and the antimicrobial
resistance patterns of _Salmonella_ spp. isolated from foods of
animal origin were evaluated. The study revealed an overall
prevalence rate of 5.5% (21 of 384) in the studied food items.
Even though there have been some studies on _Salmonella_
isolation in food items in Ethiopia [10, 12, 13], there has been
no uniformity with respect to the sample type examined; as a
result, the overall prevalence of _Salmonella_ in animal-origin
foods may not be comparable. In the combined analysis, the
overall prevalence of _Salmonella_ in this study was lower than
that reported in Thailand [18] but higher than the reports in
Morocco [19]. The difference might be the sample type and
sample procedures and the detection methods employed for



different studies. As Padungtod and Kaneene [20] described
earlier, the rate of prevalence may also vary from experiment
to experiment, from country to country, or from one area
to another area within a country. There are many potential
sources by which foods of animal origin can become contaminated; some are at the food preparation stage and others
are in the food preparing environment. Some examples of
contamination during food item processing and preparation
are storage, washing, and cutting. As a public health view,
most foodborne _Salmonella_ infections are associated with
foods of animal origin; however, recent investigations have
identified fruits and vegetables as the source of contamination
for foodborne _Salmonella_ outbreaks [21]. Transport vehicles
and processing equipment are also other examples of contamination. Unclean environment, unhygienic food handling
practices, and water sources in public places are suggestive
evidence of _Salmonella_ postpreparation contamination in this
study. Water of unknown microbiological quality can also be
an important hazard for food items [21].
In the present study, _Salmonella_ contamination in raw
meat samples was 12%, which was in close agreement with
that of Ejeta et al. [13], who reported 12% from retail raw meat
samples in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, approximately
15% of the meat samples were found to be positive at the retail
level. But our finding was lower as compared to the studies
conducted in Senegal [22] and in Iran [23]. However, the
