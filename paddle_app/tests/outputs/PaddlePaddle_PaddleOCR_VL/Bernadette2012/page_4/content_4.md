Resistance to erythromycin and amoxicillin, two antibiotics widely used to treat illness in Côte d'Ivoire, is not negligible. However, rates of that resistance are lower compared to those obtained with the fluoroquinolones.

These results are similar to previous observations  $ [19, 20, 45–48] $ . The relatively high percentages of resistance to most antimicrobial agents tested in our study may be due to high usage of these agents as growth promoters or in animal treatment. In fact, in Cote d'Ivoire, as in most of developing countries  $ [49] $ , the use of antibiotics for humans and animals is relatively unrestricted.

Furthermore, no measures of hygiene are observed in both farms and in the process of slaughter which could cause contamination of poultry carcasses. Since campylobacteriosis is transmitted by consumption of contaminated food, preferably poultry, the presence of strains of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter on chicken meat can be a real public health problem in Côte d'Ivoire. Indeed, the situation could deteriorate more rapidly in the study area, where there is an expansion of poultry farms with widespread and uncontrolled use of antibiotics. Therefore, surveillance of resistance pattern is necessary to guide rational use of antimicrobial agents in poultry farms.

In conclusion, we reported the presence of high contamination in poultry in Côte d'Ivoire by thermophilic Campylobacter and high resistance to antimicrobials of the fluoroquinolone family. These results show the need to strengthen the implementation of specific control procedures to decrease the contamination of poultry meat by Campylobacter and the necessity to reduce using antibiotics in poultry sector. This study also shows the need to establish an efficient system for the control of Campylobacter in chickens.
