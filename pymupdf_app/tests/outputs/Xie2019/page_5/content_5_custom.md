FI G U R E 3 ERIC‐PCR DNA fingerprint analysis of the _Salmonella_ isolates



rate was similar to that seen in Iran and Shaanxi, China (Badouei,

Ghalejooghi, & Madadgar, 2012; Wang et al., 2012). However, the

data on the prevalence of _Salmonella_ in eggs still show the risk of this

organism infection and can be useful for control of egg consumption

in China.

Resistance to different antibiotics has increasingly been re
ported in bacteria isolated from animals and humans and has be
come an important global issue. In particular, there is widespread

dissemination of antimicrobial‐resistant strains among _S. enterica_

(Hardjo Lugito & Cucunawangsih, 2017; Yang et al., 2015). Our

susceptibility tests revealed the _Salmonella_ isolates obtained from

eggs were highly resistant to β‐lactams antibiotic, especially ampi
cillin. This resistance ratio coincides with many previous reports,

finding that ampicillin resistance was most serious in _Salmonella_

from some Asian countries (Chiou et al., 2014). Resistance to ami
noglycosides and tetracyclines may be related to the use of feed



containing large amounts of these antibiotics in chicken farms.

Resistance to quinolones is also increasing along with prevalence

of the resistance genes (Ben et al., 2017). Our isolates also showed

resistance to other antibiotics including azithromycin (AZM) and

erythromycin (ERY), which is a public health concern as these drugs

are often used to treat human infections. In addition, many of the

strains were multidrug resistant (MDR) with some even being re
sistant to more than seven antibiotics. Wang et al also showed that

84.6% of the _Salmonella_ isolates from Shanghai, China, exhibited

MDR and proved that resistance genes play an important role in

MDR (Wang et al., 2017). Our findings indicate that it is necessary

to continue monitoring the antimicrobial resistance of _Salmonella_

isolates to help determine the appropriate antimicrobial therapy

for patients infected with this pathogen.

_Salmonella enterica_ has a wide variety of serotypes, and their

distribution has strong regional variation. There are differences in
