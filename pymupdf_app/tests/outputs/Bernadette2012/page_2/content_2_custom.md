Because of the increasing concerns of the public regarding the risk of exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria
through food, monitoring programs for antimicrobial resistances in indicator bacteria isolated from food animals have
been developed in a number of countries [24–27].
In Cˆote d’Ivoire, although poultry meat and particularly
broiler chicken is a major proteins source for the population,
no case of human campylobacteriosis has been published to
date. However, our study in 2005 [28] showed a high prevalence (67%) of _Campylobacter_ spp _._ in chickens. This situation
can be explained by the fact that _Vibrio cholerae_, _Salmonella,_
and many other microorganisms, out of _Campylobacter_,
are the priorities of health authorities of Cˆote d’Ivoire.
Therefore, survey data on the prevalence of _Campylobacter_
spp _._ mainly _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli_ (as they are responsible of
more than 98% cases of campylobacteriosis) [29] are needed.
In addition, determination of antimicrobial resistance of
_Campylobacter_ isolates from chickens is important.
The aims of this study were, on one hand, to estimate
prevalence of thermophilic C _ampylobacters_ in slaughtered
chickens in Abidjan by biochemical and molecular technical
and, on the other hand, to evaluate their antimicrobial
resistance.


**2. Material and Methods**


_2.1. Study Area and Sample Preparation._ This study was
conducted in Adjam´e, a municipality in the north part of
Abidjan. Adjam´e is the principal market of Abidjan with
more than 3 million visitors per day [30].
From May to November 2009, 119 samples of chicken
caeca were collected in a commercial poultry processing
plant. This plant is one of the primary poultry processing of
this municipality with visitors of diverse origin particularly
restaurateurs.
Each randomly selected sample was collected during
evisceration and put into a stomacher bag, then rapidly
transported to the laboratory in a cooler.


_2.2. Isolation and Biochemical Identification._ Isolation of
_Campylobacter_ was performed with passive filtration method
preceded by enrichment as proposed by Federighi [31].
Briefly, 1 g of caeca contents was transferred to 9 mL of
Preston enrichment broth base (CM 0067 Oxoid, OXOID
LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire,UK) containing _Campylobac-_
_ter_ growth factor (SR 0232E Oxoid, OXOID LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) and 7% (v/v) defibrinated sheep
blood. Incubation was performed in an anaerobic jar
containing a packet generator microaerophilic atmosphere
(5% oxygen, 10% carbon dioxide, 85% nitrogen) type
CAMPYGen (CN0025A Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire,
UK) during 24 hours at 37 _[◦]_ C. After enrichment, 300 _µ_ L of
broth was filtered through acetate cellulose filter (0.45 _µ_ m)
on Columbia agar (Sharlau; Barcelona, Spain) containing
5% (v/v) fresh sheep blood at aerobic conditions during one
hour.
The filter was removed from agar and _Campylobacter_
was isolated at 42 _[◦]_ C during 48 hours under microaerophilic
atmosphere.



One presumptive _Campylobacter_ colony from each agar
plate was subcultured and identified by Gram staining
reaction, and biochemical pattern for oxidase, catalase,
indoxyl acetate hydrolysis, and hippurate hydrolysis [32]. All
isolates were stored in 25% (v/v) glycerol-peptone broth at

_−_ 70 _[◦]_ C.


_2.3. DNA Extraction and PCR Conditions._ Genomic DNAs
from all isolated colonies were obtained by treatment
with dodecyl sulfate sodium and proteinase K followed by
extraction with phenol-chloroform and precipitation with
ethanol [33]. PCR procedures used in this study have been
described previously by Linton et al. [34]. Two genes for the
identification of _Campylobacter jejuni_ and _Campylobacter coli_
were used: _hipo_ gene (encoding _C. jejuni_ hippurase) and _asp_
gene (encoding _C. coli_ aspartokinase). Sequences of the two
sets of primers used for gene amplification are _asp_ (F 5 _[′]_ GGT ATG ATT TCT ACA AAG CGA G-3 _[′]_ and R 5 _[′]_ -ATA
TAT CGT CGC GTG AAAGAC-3 _[′]_ ) and _hipo_ (F 5 _[′]_ -GAA GAG
GGT TTG GGT GGT G-3 _[′]_ and R 5 _[′]_ -AGC CGC ATA ATA
ACT TAGCTTTG-3 _[′]_ ).
PCR was performed in final volume of 50 _µ_ L mix
containing 2.5 _µ_ L of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate
(10 mM), 2.5 _µ_ L of MgCl2 (25 mM), 10 _µ_ L of Buffer 5X DNA
Taq polymerase, 0.4 _µ_ L of Taq polymerase, 1.5 _µ_ L of each
primer _asp_ (10 _µ_ M), and 5 _µ_ L of each primer _hipo_ (10 _µ_ M).
Amplification reactions were carried out using thermal cycler
(Gene Amp PCR system type 9700, Applied Biosystems,
Villebon-sur-yvette, France) with the following program:
an initial denaturation at 94 _[◦]_ C for 15 min followed by 30
cycles of denaturation at 94 _[◦]_ C for 1 min, annealing at 49 _[◦]_ C
for 1 min and polymerization at 72 _[◦]_ C for 1 min. A final
extension was performed at 72 _[◦]_ C for 7 min.
The amplification generated 735 bp and 500 bp DNA
fragments corresponding, respectively, to _Campylobacter_
_jejuni_ and _Campylobacter coli_ . The PCR products were
stained with a 0.6% solution of ethidium bromide and were
visualized under UV light after gel electrophoresis on 1.5%
agarose.


_2.4. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing._ Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion method
using Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) supplemented with 5%
defibrinated sheep blood, according to Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [35]. Disks impregnated with antibiotics (Biomerieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France)
and their corresponding concentration are the followings:
ciprofloxacin (CIP: 5 _µ_ g); nalidixic acid (NA: 30 _µ_ g); erythromycin (E: 15 _µ_ g); gentamicin (GM: 10 UI); amoxicillin
(AMX: 25 _µ_ g).
Briefly, well-isolated colonies of same morphological
type were selected from an agar plate culture and transferred
into 10 mL of sterile saline buffer (NaCl 0.9%). After
homogenization, 2 mL of the mixture were flooded onto
the surface of a Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) containing
5% defibrinated sheep blood. The inoculum was allowed to
dry for 5 min and antibiotic discs were placed on the plate.
After 48 h of microaerobic incubation at 37 _[◦]_ C, diameters of
