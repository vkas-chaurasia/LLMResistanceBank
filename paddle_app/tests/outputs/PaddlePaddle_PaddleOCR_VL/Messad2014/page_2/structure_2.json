Preparation of raw poultry and consumption of contaminated chicken meat or chicken products in general have been identified as the main risk factor for human infection with Campylobacter (Hartnett et al., 2009, 33 p.). Sporadic human cases have been associated with consumption of under-cooked poultry meat, while larger outbreaks are associated with raw milk (Denis et al., 2011; Karagiannis et al., 2010). Acute self-limited gastrointestinal illness, characterized by diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, is the most common presentation of Campylobacter infection; fresh blood may appear in the stools. Local complications such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis and peritonitis occur rarely. It has been recognized that Guillain–Barré syndrome is the most serious complication of Campylobacter infection, with an incidence of 1/1000 infections (Butzler, 2004).",

Because of their ability to be transmitted to humans through food chain, the zoonotic enteropathogenic bacteria resistant to antibiotics, mainly Campylobacter, are more dangerous in terms of human health. In the U.S.A, consumption of poultry has been identified as a risk factor for human infection by fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species (Luangtongkum et al., 2009).",

First, at the end of rearing period, from six poultry farms, 100 freshly emitted droppings samples were collected during the last week preceding removal; second, on five slaughterhouses, after chickens evisceration, 100 samples of caeca were taken and, 100 fresh broiler chicken neck skins were collected at the end of slaughtering chain. Both cecal contents and neck skin samples were collected from the same slaughter batch (animals had the same origin and were sampled randomly in the slaughterhouse line). For each farm and slaughterhouse, a single visit was performed early in the morning; the samples were placed in sterile plastic pots (droppings and cecal contents) and sterile plastic bags (neck skins) inside an isothermal cool-box at  $ +4^{\\circ}C $  and transferred immediately to the laboratory in order to be analyzed on the same day.",
