for the spvC virulence gene. Abouzeed et al. (2000) reported similar results about the invA gene in 75 Salmonella strains from turkey meat, bovine and human samples.

PCR analysis demonstrated the h-li gene in only one of the 17 isolates. Karraouan et al. (2010) showed that 18% (7/39) of strains possess the h-li gene. The results of our study about the presence of the gene spvC are not consistent with those of Abouzeed et al. (2000); they revealed a frequency of 28% spvC gene (21/75) among different serotypes of Salmonella isolated from turkey meat, cattle and human disease samples. Our results were similar to those of Turki, Ouzari, and Ben Aissa (2012) who indicated that all strains (n = 57) of S. Kentucky isolated from different sources (animals, food and human cases) were negative for the spvC gene.

As it was reported in several countries (France, Belgium, Slovak Republic, Morocco, and Ethiopia) (Aragaw et al., 2007; Collard et al., 2007; Molla et al., 2006), we noticed a high multidrug-resistance rate in Salmonella isolated from beef.

Our study indicated that almost all (16/17) of the strains were resistant to at least one of the 12 tested antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella concerned 14/17 of the strains, including Amoxicillin (13/17), Tetracycline (12/17), Streptomycin (10/17) and Nalidixic acid (6/17). In Tunisia, to our knowledge there is no published data on antimicrobial use in farm animals. In Tunisian human medicine practice, an antibacterial treatment is not indicated for uncomplicated forms of Salmonella gastroenteritis. Quinolone therapy is reserved to clinically severe cases (Boutiba et al., 2007).

Our results are similar to those from the study of Karraouan et al. (2010) which studied antibiotic resistance of 39 Salmonella isolates from turkey meat in Morocco. This study showed that 82% (32/39) of the strains were resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics, while the multidrug-resistant strains were present in 51.3% of the samples. High percentages of resistance were observed for Sulfonamides (64%), Tetracycline (39%), Amoxicillin (31%) and Nalidixic acid (36%). The rates of resistance against Amoxicillin and Tetracycline were high in Tunisian hospitals (54.5% and 40% respectively) (Boutiba et al., 2007).

Furthermore, our study showed that all the strains were sensitive to Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid association and Cefoxitin. But, Boutiba et al. (2007) reported a high rate of resistance against third generation cephalosporin in Tunisian hospitals (33%). S. Kentucky was the most resistant serotype (9/12). Similar results were reported by Karraouan et al. (2010).

### 5. Conclusion

Our study revealed a low prevalence of Salmonella spp. meat contamination. This rate varied from naught for bulls meat to 14% for culled cows' meat. In addition, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. was higher in summer and in cattle with digestive disorders. Six serotypes of Salmonella were identified; S. Montevideo was the most frequent, followed by S. Anatum, S. Minnesota, S. Amsterdam, S. Kentucky and S. Brandenburg. Unlike other serotypes, S. Montevideo was present during the whole year except winter. All Salmonella strains were positive for invasion gene invA and negative for spvC virulence gene. Only one (S. Kentucky) was positive for h-li gene. Almost all of the strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella concerned many serotypes, including Amoxicillin, Tetracycline, Streptomycin and Nalidixic acid. S. Kentucky was the most resistant serotype. The association of multidrug-resistance and invasion gene in Salmonella isolates justifies the need of surveillance system for both human and animal health sectors.
