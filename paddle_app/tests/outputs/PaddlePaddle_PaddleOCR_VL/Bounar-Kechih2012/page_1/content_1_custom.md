## ABSTRACT
 This study aims at identifying serotypes and surveying the antimicrobial resistance and plasmid support of resistance of 100 Salmonella strains, which were isolated from 96 out of 506 (18.97%) samples taken from different production farms in the wilayah (i.e., Algerian states) of Tizi-Ouzou, Bouira, Bejaia, and Boumerdes in 2007. The highest percentage of Salmonella (48%) was recorded in Bouira. Thirteen serotypes were identified among the 100 Salmonella strains used in this study. The most prevalent ones were Salmonella Heidelberg (24%), Salmonella Enteritidis (20%), Salmonella Albany (16%), and Salmonella Typhimurium (9%). The strains showed resistance to 8 of the 34 antibiotics tested. Fifty-three percent of strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic, among which 15.09% were multiresistant. The most frequently observed resistance was to quinolones (58.49%), with a contribution

of 94.74% of Salmonella Heidelberg resistant strains. The plasmid transfer performed on 53 strains showed that only 11 exhibited one or more markers of resistance, the most frequent being ampicillin, followed by tetracycline, then cotrimoxazole, sulphonamides, and kanamycin, in that order. The tetracycline characteristics were present in 72.72% of transconjugants, those of the  $ \beta $ -lactams and sulphonamides in 27.27% each and those of the aminosides in 9.09%. The incompatibility groups of plasmids belong to the F1me and Com1 classes, and the molecular weight of the plasmid DNA was greater than 100 kb. The phenotypic and genotypic results indicate a clonal dissemination in the Gallus gallus species in this particular study; this phenomenon could generate resistant bacteria and transferable genes of resistance to humans.

Key words: Salmonella, Gallus gallus, antimicrobial resistance profile, plasmid profile, incompatibility group

## I NTRODUCTION

The production and consumption of poultry has increased considerably worldwide. Poultry production has left the farmyard and is now industrialized and conducted in a more rational manner (Delpech, 1992). In Algeria, since the 1980s, the emergence of the poultry industries increased the consumption of animal proteins at a much affordable cost (Ferrah et al., 2003). Poultry represents one of the main reservoirs of Salmonella that are responsible for a major zoonosis with serious economic and public health consequences (Brisabois, 2001). Antimicrobial agents played a dominant role for the treatment and the control of the salmonellosis. Their overconsumption contributed to the emergence of resistances. In fact, despite the decrease of salmonellosis incidence in the world, multiresistant strains

appeared in humans and became increasingly alarming in both industrialized and developing countries (Brisabois, 2001). The surveillance of the current bacterial resistances should not be exclusively based on the determination of the resistant phenotypes. The genetic characterization by conjugation is currently the most used tool in Algeria to better understand the spread of antibiotic resistance in zoonotic bacteria, until the introduction of molecular biology techniques.

Our objectives were the phenotypic characterization of 100 Salmonella strains by determining the circulating serotypes in the study's area, the antimicrobial resistance profiles, as well as the genotypic characterization.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Sampling

As part of official control of poultry in 4 wilayas of Algeria, from January to December 2007, 100 Salmonella strains were isolated from 506 avian samples during autopsies of slain live subjects. This was conducted
