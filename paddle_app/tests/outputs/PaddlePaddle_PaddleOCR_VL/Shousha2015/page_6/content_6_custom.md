Phage Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance in Chicken Meat

present, this is not extensively used for disinfection. It is thus highly likely that phages survive under routine conditions of disinfection not only in the food industry.

Our results show for the first time that generalized transduction without the need for homologous recombination is a neglected but nevertheless efficient way to transfer antimicrobial resistance to  $ E.\ coli $  in different environments, including in food of animal origin. This conclusion has important consequences for hygiene, sanitation, and public health when it is important to combat antimicrobial resistance.
