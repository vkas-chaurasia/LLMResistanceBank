Abstract


Coagulase-positive (CPS) and coagulase-negative (CNS) staphylococci cause staphylococcal food poisoning.
Recently, CPS and CNS have received increasing attention due to their potential role in the dissemination of
antibiotic resistance markers. The present study aimed to evaluate CPS and CNS species distribution and their
antibiotic resistance profile isolated from chicken and beef meat. Fifty fresh, uncooked chicken parts and 50
beef meat cuts (local n = 27; imported n = 23) were used. One hundred staphylococcal isolates belonging to 11
species were isolated and identified from chicken (n = 50) and beef (n = 50) raw meat samples. Staphylococcus
hyicus (26/100), lugdunensis (18/100), aureus (15/100) and epidermidis (14/100) were dominant. S. aureus was
100% resistant to penicillin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus showed intermediate resistance (51%), which might indicate the dissemination of vancomycin resistance in the community and imply food safety hazards. The percentage of resistance to b-lactams was variable, with the highest
resistance being to penicillin (94%) and lowest to ampicillin-sulbactam (22%). Antimicrobial resistance was
mainly against penicillin (94%), clindamycin (90%) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (82%). The results
indicate that chicken and beef raw meat are an important source of antibiotic-resistant CPS and CNS.



Introduction

he poultry industry in Egypt with a population of 1
billion broilers is estimated to produce 1.5 metric tons
# T
(MT) of poultry meat during the period of 2014 (Hassan,
2014).The investment in the poultry industry is around 25
billion Egyptian pounds, and ranks first in the Middle East
(Hassan, 2014). The beef meat imports were around 230 MT
in the year 2014 (USDA, 2014). Chicken meat contributes
substantially to the diet in Egypt, and is an important, lowcost source of animal protein encouraging the consumption of
chicken meat by a large number of consumers.
Today, according to the current List of Bacterial Names
with Standing in Nomenclature (Euze´by, 2014), the genus
Staphylococcus comprises 71 species, with 24 named subspecies. Staphylococcal food poisoning is believed to be
greatly underreported (by about 25-fold) and underdiagnosed
(by about 29-fold) (Doyle et al., 2012). The consumption of
chicken and beef meat was implicated in a large number of
outbreaks of staphylococcal food poisoning in humans in
different countries (Argudı´n et al., 2010). Discrimination
between Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and NSA (non-S. aureus
staphylococci) involved in meat contamination is essential in
terms of public health significance. Most staphylococci spe


cies are coagulase-negative (CNS) and they are distinguished
from coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) by their inability to produce the enzyme coagulase. Although CPS, and
especially S. aureus, are regarded as important pathogens in
humans and animals, CNS should not be ignored in epidemiological investigations of foodborne outbreaks based on
the presence of enterotoxin genes (Rall et al., 2010; Batista
et al., 2013). In the last 20 years, however, the interest in CNS
species has significantly increased in both human and veterinary medicine (Rogers et al., 2009; Braem et al., 2014).
Information regarding the detailed prevalence of S. aureus
and NSA isolates was insufficient in Egypt.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of S.
aureus and NSA and between CPS and CNS strains isolated
from retail chicken and beef marketed in Cairo, Egypt, by
using cultural and biochemical tests, to determine their diversity between samples and to characterize the isolated
strains based on their resistance to antibiotics.


Materials and Methods


A total of 100 samples each of chicken (n = 50) and beef
(local, n = 27 and imported, n = 23) were randomly collected
from various local supermarkets and butcher shops. All

samples collected were unprocessed raw and fresh meat. The
samples were aseptically collected, and each sample was
placed in a separate, sterile plastic bag. The samples were
brought under refrigeration to the laboratory and analyzed
within the following 2 h. The samples (25 g) were weighed
into sterile stomacher bags diluted with 225-mL sterile
buffered peptone water and homogenized in a stomacher for
about 5 min; 0.1 mL was streaked on Baird-Parker (BP) agar
supplemented with egg yolk–tellurite emulsion and incubated at 37�C for 24 h. Strains cultured on BP agar medium
were identified as S. aureus if growth was observed and the
colonies and their surrounding showed the typical morphologic characteristics after aerobic incubation at 37�C (black
colonies with an opaque precipitation halo); growth of colonies without the media-typical characteristics was considered as NSA. The tube coagulate test was determined and
evaluated for coagulation after 3 and 24 h of incubation. All
isolates identified as NSA and CNS based on colony morphology, Gram staining (positive), catalase reaction (positive), and coagulase test (positive) were subjected to species
identification by using all the conventional biochemical
methods described by Thorberg and Brandstrom (2000). For
novobiocin-sensitive CNS isolates identified in samples, a
simplified identification system, novobiocin-sensitive CNS
built on biochemical tests was used (Thorberg and Brandstrom, 2000). To confirm the isolates as Staphylococcus,
definitive identification of all strains included in the study
was performed targeting the Staphylococcus genus-specific
16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (fragment of
756 bp); F: AAC TCT GTT ATT AGG GAA GAA CA and
R: CCA CCT TCC TCC GGT TTG TCA CC as previously
described (Zhang et al., 2004). For the positive control,
S. aureus (ATCC 43300) reference strain was used as control
for the test results.
The resistance pattern of Staphylococcus spp. isolates was
determined using the disk-diffusion test (CLSI, 2012). Eleven antibiotics were chosen for the study based on the most
used active principles in human medicine, national veterinary
therapy, and according to their common use in research. The
use of oxacillin/methicillin is not usually used in veterinary
practice, and it was included in this study only for epidemiological purposes; the drugs tested are indicated in Table 1.
S. aureus American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 29213
and S. aureus ATCC 43300 were used as methicillinsusceptible and -resistant controls, respectively.


Results and Discussion


Cairo is the largest city in the Middle East with a population
of more than 16 million. Due to overcrowding and in some
areas a state of poverty, inadequate sanitary conditions and
poor general hygiene are seen. Raw meat is sold and available
in open-air local retail shops without appropriate temperature
control and is purchased by approximately 75% of households
(ElNaggar et al., 2006; Kader and Yahia, 2012).
Contaminated raw meat is one of the main sources of
foodborne illnesses and a risk of the transmission of zoonotic
infections. CPS and CNS are well established as clinical and
epidemiological pathogens, and their potentially pathogenic
role as foodborne pathogens should not be neglected. From
the 100 samples inspected, 100 isolates (100/100; 100%
isolation rate) belonging to 11 species were obtained (Table



2), from which the most dominant were S. hyicus (26/100),
lugdunensis (18/100), aureus (15/100), and epidermidis (14/
100). Studies have reported rates of 6% to 100% from Spain
(Alvarez-Astorga et al., 2002), Japan (Kitai et al., 2005), Italy
(Normanno et al., 2007), The Netherlands (van Loo et al.,
2007), Nigeria (Achi and Madubuike, 2007), Jordan (AlTarazi et al., 2009), Korea (Lim et al., 2010), United States
(Waters et al., 2011), Turkey (Citak and Duman, 2011), India
(Arul and Saravanan, 2011), China (Wang et al., 2013),
EFSA (2013), Egypt (EI-Jakee et al., 2013), and Thailand
(Akbar and Anil, 2013). The isolation rate of the Staphylococcus species recorded in our investigation on local beef
meat (3.7%) was much lower than that recorded from the
imported beef meat (47.8%), while the S. aureus contamination constituted a significantly higher rate in the local beef
meat (33.3%) than in the imported beef meat (13.0%).
The isolation rates recorded in beef were higher than those
previously reported by Heo et al. (2008), who reported there
was no significance difference in the frequency of S. aureus
isolation between imported (10.3%) and domestic (8%) raw
beef samples.
The isolation and prevalence data are variable and differ
between various countries, and comparison between studies
is inadvisable. Nevertheless, comparisons could still be
made, noting that there are limiting factors due to inherent
differences in methodology (sampling techniques, sample
size, type of samples, sampling seasons, and sites [geographical locations, supermarkets, groceries, butcher shops,
vendors/hawkers], identification methods), packaging, display at the butcher shop and handling practices, food settings,
slaughterhouse and butcher appliances (knives, slicing machines, wiping cloths, towels, and nail brushes), and in grocery store meatburger grinders (EC, 2011). These factors
differ greatly between countries and even within the same
country, especially in the underdeveloped world. As meat
may originally become contaminated during or after processing, the great significance of slaughter hygiene should be
emphasized due to the problem of the increased speed of
current production lines (Jacob, 1989). The three slaughterhouse tasks most likely to contaminate meat are the removal
of an animal’s hide, the removal of its digestive system, and
the spread of feedlots at slaughterhouses and slaughterhouse
workers who are often illiterate and always overworked (EC,
2011). Other contamination sources of S. aureus are soil,
water, dust and air, changes in eating habits, and mass catering; also, complex and lengthy food-supply procedures
with increased international movement are additional contributing factors (Jacob, 1989).
In addition to these factors, the most important underestimated source is the asymptomatic food handlers, who
may harbor S. aureus and can contaminate food during
preparation (Todd et al., 2008). Staphylococcus spp. are
widely found as normal flora in the nose and throat (and thus
on the hands and fingertips) and on the hair and skin of more
than 50% of healthy individuals (FDA, 2009). Food handlers
who have skin lesions, or by sneezing or coughing, are a
major source of contamination of table foods (FDA, 2009).
However, testing of humans (food handlers) who came into
contact with the study was not an objective of this study and
therefore was never attempted. Any food that requires handling in preparation may therefore easily become contaminated. Infected wounds, lesions, and boils of food handlers

may also be sources of contamination, as well as coughing
and sneezing by individuals with respiratory infections
(McEntire, 2004). S. aureus contaminations are often associated with institutions such as hospitals, schools, and prisons, where food is often prepared in mass quantities and held
until consumption (McEntire, 2004). Lack of sanitation by
workers and improper time–temperature combinations during storage can lead to contamination of the product and
growth of the microorganism to levels at which toxin is
produced (McEntire, 2004).
Podkowik et al. (2012) showed that raw chicken and beef
meat are an important source of CNS and that they received
increasing attention due to their potential role in the dissemination of antibiotic-resistance markers in the community and
imply food-safety hazards. The antimicrobial resistance profile of the tested CPS and CNS isolates to different antibiotics
is recorded in Table 1. All investigated CPS and CNS isolates
were resistant to at least one antibiotic. A high overall resistance to antibiotics was observed, again possibly from using
antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed (Wise, 2007),
especially those commonly used for both human and animal
care, which should consequently be avoided. Antimicrobial
resistance was mainly against penicillin (94%), clindamycin
(90%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (82%). Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus showed intermediate resistance
(51%), which might indicate the dissemination of vancomycin resistance in the community and imply food-safety
hazards (Martins et al., 2013). The percentage of resistance to
b-lactams was variable, with the highest resistance being to
penicillin (94%) and lowest to ampicillin-sulbactam (22%).
CNS are more resistant than S. aureus and may be a source of
b-lactam resistance genes (de Medeiros et al., 2011).
These findings highlight the high potential risk for consumers in the absence of strict hygienic and preventative
measures to avoid the presence of CPS and CNS isolates in
foods. Emphasis should be placed on implementing The



Codex Alimentarius Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat
(CHPM), which includes the primary international standard
for meat hygiene and incorporates a risk-based approach to
application of sanitary measures throughout the meat production chain (OIE, 2014). Also, contamination during the
distribution and consumption of the final food products must
be taken into account. In addition, the potential trade impacts
of beef meat garners attention to the multidrug-resistant
characteristics of the isolated CPS and CNS and their possible
international spread, which poses a threat to public health
through their ability to be transferred to humans. Our results
show the need for and importance of improving monitoring
data and global cooperation in controlling food contamination, raising the sense of urgency to prevent a more threatening drug-resistant bacteria from emerging and unleashing a
pandemic. Our findings also provide useful information for
public health projects in Egypt, and indicate that the implementation of the Codex Committee on Food Import and
Export Inspection and Certification Systems (CCFICS) and
the OIE Handbook on Import Risk Analysis for Animals and
Animal Products publication, which provide guidelines useful to bilateral parties to develop principles and guidelines in
this area, has become a must and that food control should
cover both export and import.
