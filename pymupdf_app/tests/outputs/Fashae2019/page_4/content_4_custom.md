Hospitals A and B accounted for 21 of the
isolates. These two hospitals also accounted for four
out of seven (57%) _S_ . Dublin, 10 out of 13 (77%) _S_ .
Enteritidis, and six out of seven (86%) _S_ .
Typhimurium (Table 3). None of the serovars found
in humans were observed among the isolates from
chicken (Tables 3 and 4).


_Serotyping of chicken isolates_

The 70 _Salmonella_ isolates revealed eight
different serovars with _S_ . Virchow being the most
frequent, accounting for 71% (n = 50) of all serovars
isolated from chickens. _S_ . Virchow was found in
chickens from 11 of the 12 farms, accounting for
92% (n = 22) and 83% (n = 10) of all serovars found
on farms J and K. Additionally, it was the only
serovar originating from chickens in farms B, C, and
D (Table 2). Two uncommon serovars from chickens
were isolated: _S_ . Haifa (n = 2; 3%) and _S_ . Onireke (n
= 1; 1%) (Table 2).


_Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of human isolates_

The _Salmonella_ isolates originating from humans
were all susceptible to apramycin, ceftiofur, colistin,
florfenicol, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and neomycin.
Low frequency of resistance was observed to
nalidixic acid (3%) and ciprofloxacin (3%).



Antimicrobial resistance to spectinomycin,
chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin
ranged from 18% to 44%. A higher frequency of
antimicrobial resistance was observed to
sulfamethoxazole (54%), trimethoprim (54%),
amoxicillin+clavulanic (54%), and ampicillin (59%)
(Table 4). Three of the seven _S._ Dublin were resistant
to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline, and trimethoprim; the remaining four
isolates were pansusceptible. Antimicrobial
resistance was observed in eleven of the 13 _S._
Enteritidis isolates. Four _S_ . Enteritidis isolates
conferred resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. Two additional
isolates also conferred resistance to streptomycin.
One of the remaining five _S_ . Enteritidis isolates was
resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim, streptomycin,
amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, nalidixic acid, and
tetracycline. None of the 13 _S_ . Enteritidis isolates
were pansusceptible (data not shown). Six of seven _S._
Typhi isolates were pansusceptible while the
remaining one isolate was resistant only to
streptomycin.


_Antimicrobial_ _susceptibility_ _testing_ _of_ _chicken_
_isolates_

All 70 chicken isolates were susceptible to
apramycin, ceftiofur, chloramphenicol, colistin,
