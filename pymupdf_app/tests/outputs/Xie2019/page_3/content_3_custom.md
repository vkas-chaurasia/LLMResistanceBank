antibiotic disks as specified by the CLSI. Ampicillin (AMP) resist
ance was the most common with 32 (59.26%) resistant strains. As

shown in Table 1, our strains were resistant to β‐lactams antibi
otic, including amoxicillin (37.04%), cephazolin (38.89%), penicillin

(33.33%), and piperacillin (29.63%). Following this, similar levels

of antibiotic resistances were shown by isolates to aminoglyco
sides and tetracyclines antibiotics, such as gentamicin (18.52%),

kanamycin (53.70%), streptomycin (27.78%), minocycline (31.48%),

and tetracycline (42.59%) were similar. Only a few strains were

resistant to macrolides and quinolones antibiotics, for example

azithromycin (9.26%), erythromycin (7.41%), ciprofloxacin (9.26%),

and nalidixic acid (12.96%). Of note, only six isolates were L193 to

any of the tested antibiotics, and most isolates were resistant to

more than three antibiotics (Table S1). In particular, three strains

were resistant to seven antibiotics (SalE4, SalE24, SalE54), and one

was resistant to eight (SalE13).


**3.3** | **Serotypes phenotype**


Somatic ‐O and ‐H antisera agglutination serotyped the 54 _Salmonella_

isolates into 11 different serovars (Figure 1). Their distribution is

as follows: _S._ Agona (3), _S._ Derby (5), _S._ Enteritidis (14), _S._ Give (4),

_S._ Heidelberg (2), _S._ Meleagridis (3), _S._ Pullorum (12), _S._ Rissen (5),

_S._ Senftenberg (3), _S._ Typhimurium(2), and _S._ Weltevreden (1).
