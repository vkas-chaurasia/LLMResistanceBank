emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant and potentially
more pathogenic strains. Antimicrobial-resistant _Salmonella_
spp. have been isolated from different foods of animal origin
around the world, which is attributed to the inappropriate
use of antimicrobials as therapeutic or prophylactic agents in
human and veterinary medicine, as well as the use of growth
promoters in animal production [8]. _Salmonella_ strains resistant to various antimicrobial agents, particularly resistant to
fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins, are
considered as an emerging problem worldwide [9], resulting
in higher morbidity and mortality rates and higher overall
treatment costs. This may represent a public health risk by
transfer of resistant _Salmonella_ strains to humans through
the consumption of contaminated food and food products.
However, the sources and transmission routes of _Salmonella_
in developing countries are poorly understood due to the lack
of coordinated national epidemiological surveillance systems

[3].
The incidence of foodborne _Salmonella_ infections has
increased dramatically in Ethiopia during the past few years.
Studies conducted in different parts of the country have
demonstrated the presence of _Salmonella_ in human beings

[6, 10, 11] and in different food animals and food products

[10, 12–14]. Despite these attempts to report the prevalence
and distribution of _Salmonella_ spp. in some food items,
humans, and food animals in Ethiopia [10–12], the problem
of this pathogen in foods of animal origin is still not well
known. However, studies made elsewhere indicated that
foods of animal origin are important sources of _Salmonella_,
particularly among those raw food consumers. In Gondar,
the most touristic city in Ethiopia, there is not enough information on foodborne _Salmonella_ prevalence in different food
items such as foods from animal origin or others. Therefore,
this study reports the presence of _Salmonella_ including its
antimicrobial-resistant profiles in foods of animal origin in
Gondar.


**2. Materials and Methods**


_2.1. Study Location._ The study was conducted in Gondar,
which is located in the northwest of Ethiopia, 740 km away
from the capital, Addis Ababa. The town is one of the historic
and touristic centers in Ethiopia. The altitude of the town
ranges from 1800 to 2200 meters above sea level. It has
average rainfall of 1000 millimeters per annum. The annual
average maximum and minimum temperature of the town
are 30.7 [∘] C and 22 [∘] C, respectively, with an overall average of
26 [∘] C. The town has relative humidity varying from 60% to
70% during the rainy season and from 30% to 40% during the
dry season. The human population of the town is estimated at
214 000 inhabitants [15]. In the town, a number of people are
involved in the public service business, including smallholder
farming supplying food animals and animal products to the
communities and the slaughterhouse.


_2.2. Study Design and Sampling._ A cross-sectional study
was conducted between February 2014 and December 2015
to assess the prevalence of _Salmonella_ isolates and their
antibiotic-resistant profiles from foods of animal origin in



Gondar. Stratified random sampling from catering establishments and a list frame of public places were used as
sample source according to the accessibility of animal-origin
food items. First, we looked up the functional catering
establishments registered in the city and then we stratified the
public places into strata (cafeterias, hotels, restaurants, and
pastry and retail shops) and used them as a sampling frame.
Study foods of animal origin were selected during dining time
using a simple random sampling method in each public place
on proportional bases.


_2.3. Animal-Origin Food Items._ A total of 384 animal-origin
food samples were purchased from restaurants, hotels, cafeterias, and pastry and retail shops, including egg sandwich,
minced and raw meat, burger patties, cottage cheese, cream
cake, and beef pizza. In addition, raw egg and pasteurized and
raw milk were bought from supermarkets and retail shops.
Some of the animal-origin foods may not be considered
“ready to eat” in all countries, as they would define “ready to
eat” as having been processed, such as via cooking to a specific
temperature for food safety. However, in Ethiopia, eating raw
animal-origin foods like minced and raw beef, as well as milk,
is a common practice. Time of sampling was scheduled at the
beginning of the serving period (breakfast, lunch, or dinner
time). Sterile forceps and spoons were used to transfer the
food items from the eating plate to sampling containers. The
collected samples were properly identified by sample type,
date of collection, and sources and immediately transported
to the laboratory in an ice box with freeze packs under completely sterile conditions for microbiological analysis [16].


_2.4. Isolation and Identification of Salmonella._ Standard cultivation method recommended by the International Organization for Standardization [16] was carried out for isolation
and identification of _Salmonella_ . Briefly, 25 gm of each food
sample was weighed and homogenized in sterile stomacher
bag (Stomacher 400R, Seward, England) with 225 mL of
preenrichment buffered peptone water for 2 min. The nonselective preenriched sample, from each solid or liquid food
sample, was mixed thoroughly and incubated overnight at
37 [∘] C. Following incubation, 1 mL of the preenrichment broth
was transferred to every 10 mL of tetrathionate broth (M¨ullerKaufmann, Oxoid, England), for first selective enrichment
of _Salmonella_ growth while inhibiting other microorganisms, and incubated at 37 [∘] C for 18–24 hours. In addition,
0.1 mL of preenrichment broth was added to 10 mL of
Rappaport-Vassiliadis (Oxoid, England) broth for second
selective enrichment and incubated at 41 [∘] C for 18–24 hours.
For isolation of _Salmonella_ species, each suspected colony
from selectively enriched medium was streaked onto selective
xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) agar plates and incubated
at 37 [∘] C for 18–24 hours. _Salmonella_ suspected colonies from
XLD agar medium were plated onto nutrient agar (Oxoid,
England) plates to use for biochemical confirmation.


_2.5. Biochemical Confirmation of the Isolates._ Each identified
colony with typical _Salmonella_ morphology was confirmed
biochemically by inoculating into triple sugar iron (TSI)
agar, methyl red-Voges-Proskauer (MR-VP) broth, indole
