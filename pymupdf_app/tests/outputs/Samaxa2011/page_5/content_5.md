Salmonella serotypes consistently associated with clinical
cases is published by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (7). S. enterica subsp. salamae II was the most
prevalent serotype in all types of sausage in this study.
However, this strain appears to be nonpathogenic and is not
listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Our search of the literature did not reveal any cases in which
this strain has been implicated in outbreaks. Salmonella
Muenchen was prevalent in only three types of sausages. It
was highly prevalent in chicken sausages but was not
isolated from beef sausages, a peculiar finding that warrants
more research. Salmonella Muenchen has been implicated
in some outbreaks associated with unpasteurized orange
juice in the United States and Canada (5, 6). Other outbreaks
of Salmonella Muenchen infection have been reported by
Proctor et al. (22) as associated with consumption of raw
alfalfa sprouts. Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella
Enteritidis are key serotypes that were isolated from beef
and chicken sausages, respectively. These serotypes are
well-known causes of gastroenteritis in humans (11) and
further illustrate the potential risk that sausages could pose
to consumers.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all 65
Salmonella isolates were resistant to a minimum of four
antibiotics, and some isolates were resistant to as many as
seven antibiotics. All 65 isolates were resistant to amikacin,



cefuroxime, gentamicin, and tombramycin, which was
unexpected and a significant result of this study. With the
exception of cefuroxime, which is a second generation
cephalosporin, the other three antibiotics are aminoglycosides and could share the same resistance mechanism. The
16S rRNA methylases confer resistance to aminoglycosides
in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (8). These
results may indicate the presence of a 16S rRNA methylase
gene cluster located on a highly mobile genetic element or
the huge selection pressure exerted by the indiscriminant
use of the antibiotics as veterinary drugs or prophylaxis in
animal husbandry. Mobile genetic elements bearing signatures of the 16S rRNA methylase gene cluster have not been
reported. Because most of the isolates with this predominant
resistance pattern were found in the beef sausages, the
beef industry could be the source of this genetic element.
However, the chicken sausages had the most diverse
antibiotic resistance patterns, indicating that the chicken
processing industry also could be affected by the abuse of
antibiotics. Subtyping of these isolates by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis or more discriminatory molecular typing
techniques could yield a better understanding of the genetic
relatedness of these isolates and the spread of these strains in
the environment.

In previous studies, the Salmonella isolates from beef
products were predominantly resistant to tetracycline (33.3%
