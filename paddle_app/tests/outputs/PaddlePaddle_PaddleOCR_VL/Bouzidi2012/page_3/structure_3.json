Each pool of drag swabs used to sample dust and surfaces was immersed separately in 100 mL BPW per swab. Each cotton-tipped swab was placed in 9 mL BPW, and 25 mL water samples were placed in sterile bags containing 225 mL buffered peptone water. Pooled feces and feed samples were mixed in a Stomacher bag for 1 min. All the samples were incubated for  $ 18 \\pm 2 $  h at  $ 37^{\\circ} $ C.

Following incubation, one loopful from each selective enrichment tube was streaked over two selective media – Hektoen and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar plates (AES Chemunex, Combourg, France) – prior to incubation at  $ 37^{\\circ} $ C for 18 to 24 h. Two typical colonies of Salmonella were confirmed by biochemical assays on Triple Sugar Iron (Biokar, Beauvais, France) and APl20E strips (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Salmonella isolates were then serotyped by a slide agglutination test with polyvalent O and H antiserum (Bio-Rad, Marne la coquette, France). The Kauffmann–White scheme was used to serotype the different isolates (Popoff, 2001).",

However, univariate associations suggest risk indicators, and are a preliminary but necessary step in the investigation of risk factors for any disease. Statistical analyses were limited to Fisher's Exact tests and calculation of Relative Risks (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals in order to quantify the relationship between each factor and the Salmonella status of laying-hen flocks. Discrepancies may exist between p-values and 95% confidence interval boundaries because Fisher's Exact test is a non-parametric test and 95% confidence intervals are calculated using a parametric method. The significance of associations is based on Fisher's Exact test, and not on the presence or absence of 1 in the confidence intervals. Only factors with a  $ RR \\geq 2 $  are presented. All tests were two-tailed and p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.",
