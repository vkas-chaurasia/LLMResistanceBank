RESULTS
In this study, out of 450 samples collected, 86 (19%) were contaminated by Salmonella spp (Table 1). Salmonella were
found in 27% (47/175), 18% (9/50), 11% (19/175) and 22% (11/50) respectively of beef, beef intestine, mutton and sheep
intestine.

The antibiotic susceptibility test showed resistant mutton. Low resistance between 30% and 2% in beef and
Salmonella strains. Of the 86 Salmonella spp isolated in between 42% and 5% in mutton were observed for other
beef meat and mutton, 36% and 47% were respectively antibiotics tested. In addition, strains of Salmonella
resistant to at least three or more families of antibiotics isolated in intestine products resist only to tetracycline
(Table 2). Overall resistance was most frequently (78%) and cefalotin (56%) for beef intestine and (73%) to
observed to tetracycline and cefalotin respectively 91% tetracycline for sheep intestine (Table 2).
