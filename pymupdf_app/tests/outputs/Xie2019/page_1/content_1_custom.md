**Abstract**

_Salmonella enterica_ is a common foodborne pathogen responsible for major global

health problems such as paratyphoid fever and gastroenteritis. Here, we report the

prevalence, antibiotic resistance phenotypes, serotypes, and molecular subtyping of

_Salmonella_ isolated from eggs in Guangdong, China. Out of 1,000 egg samples, 54

(5.40%) were positive. _S._ Enteritidis made up the largest proportion of samples with

11 serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility test indicated that most strains were re
sistant to β‐lactam, aminoglycoside, and tetracycline antibiotics (27.00%–40.00%).

There were 37 STs based on MLST typing. MLST and ERIC‐PCR classified 54 isolates

into three and five clusters, respectively, which revealed the genetic relatedness and

diversity. In conclusion, frequent monitoring of eggs for _Salmonella_, antibiotic resist
ance profiles and genetic diversity is essential for improving food safety.

In recent decades, antimicrobial resistance has emerged and

evolved in many bacterial as the excessive use of antimicrobials in



_Salmonella enterica_ is a major foodborne pathogen that infects

approximately 9 million people worldwide and is responsible for

155,000 deaths annually, causing serious economic losses (Huang

et al., 2016; Li, Ye, et al., 2017). It is well known that this pathogen is

mainly spread by unsafe handling of uncooked animal food products

including egg, chicken, and pork (Gillespie, O'Brien, Adak, Ward, &

Smith, 2005; Wang et al., 2012). As an important foodborne patho
gen in China, _Salmonella_ was responsible for approximately 70%–

80% of foodborne pathogenic outbreaks (Wang, Zheng, & Wang,

2007). Typhoidal _Salmonella_ causes severe and life‐threatening dis
eases, while nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ is associated with self‐limiting

diseases such as gastroenteritis, but still severe systemic infections

occur in infants, the elderly, and immune‐compromised individuals

(Ceyssens, Mattheus, Vanhoof, & Bertrand, 2015).

human and aquaculture systems (Kang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013).

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in _Salmonella_ to antibi
otics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole will

further complicate the treatment and management of enteric fever

(Ejaz et al., 2017). Strains that have been detected are resistant to

some clinical first‐line antibiotics used in the treatment of severe

_Salmonella_ infections (Boonkhot, Tadee, & Patchanee, 2015). As an
tibiotic‐resistant bacteria can be directly transmitted through the

food chain or transfer their antimicrobial resistance to human patho
gens by mobile genetic elements, it is important to monitor antibiotic

resistance among _Salmonella_ isolates and control the risk.

Serotyping is a phenotypic characteristic that is a useful epidemi
ological marker for _Salmonella_ . More than 2,600 serotypes have been

reported (Abbott, Ni, & Janda, 2012). The prevalence of _Salmonella_

serovars in different countries also varies over time and regions.

For example, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis is the most common serovar in
