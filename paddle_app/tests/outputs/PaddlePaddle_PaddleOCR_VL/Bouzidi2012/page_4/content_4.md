No Salmonella-positive sample for pools of feed and surface swabs samples. Ciprofloxacin MIC≥8  $ \mu $ g/mL.

were resistant to at least three different antibiotic classes. All three S. Kentucky and two isolates of S. Hadar were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and streptomycin, these five isolates being resistant to cephalotin too. The three S. Kentucky isolates were also resistant to fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were tested,  $ MIC_{cipro} \geq 8 \, mg/L $ ). S. Typhimurium was resistant to ampicillin. S. Manhattan, S. Virchow and S. Dublin isolates were 100% susceptible to all tested antimicrobials (Table 2).

#### 3.3. Risk indicators associated with the Salmonella status of flocks

Six out of fifteen risk indicators were considered as pertinent indicators since their RR was  $ \geq $ 2. However, none was found to be significantly related to contamination (p<0.05; Table 3), probably because of the small population. Salmonella contamination of flocks was more frequent when (i) the layer house was easily accessible (RR=3.5, CI 95%=0.5, 25; p=0.1), (ii) the buildings were not disinfected before pullets were loaded (RR=2.7, CI 95%=0.4, 16.9, p=0.2), (iii) ventilation was poor (RR=2.6, CI 95%=1.03, 6.5; p=0.08), (iv) dead hens were stored on the farms for at least 1 week (RR=2.6; CI 95%=1.0, 6.5; p=0.08), (v) we observed living or dead rodents inside the henhouse on each sampling visit (RR=2.6; CI 95%=0.8, 7.6; p=0.08), and when (vi) cages were dry cleaned only before pullets were loaded (RR=2, CI 95%=0.7, 5.3; p=0.2) (Table 3).
