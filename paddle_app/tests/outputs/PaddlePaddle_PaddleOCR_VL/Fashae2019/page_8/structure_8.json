Virchow was listed as the seventh most common serovar isolated from broiler meat in 2007  $ [46] $ . S. Virchow was observed in all farms expect G, with a high prevalence of 24% and 13% in farms J and K. Interestingly, S. Enteritidis was not isolated from chicken in this study. In contrast, S. Enteritidis is the most predominant serovar in Gallus Gallus flocks in the European Union, with a prevalence of 38%  $ [46] $ . This difference may be explained by differences in export patterns, production systems, climate, or feed. Recently, S. Hiduddify, a rare serovar, was found to be the predominant serovar in chickens in Maiduguri, Northern Nigeria  $ [20] $ , but was also not isolated in the fecal samples of chickens in this study. Northern Nigeria is generally warmer than the region of this study; moreover, the chickens studied by Raufu et al. were largely free range in contrast to the intensively reared chickens we studied, which this may suggest the presence of S. Hiduddify in the environment where chickens likely pick up the serovar from foodstuffs as they scavenge for foods in the environment. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed in free-range chickens in the south or by investigation of the environment in Maiduguri, Nigeria. We also isolated S. Onireke, a rare serovar in chickens from Ibadan, Nigeria. We speculate that those rare isolates found in chicken also originate from reptiles or the environment like the rare serovars obtained from invasive Salmonella in humans, but further research is needed to explore this hypothesis.",

In Europe, S. Virchow and S. Derby are among the ten most frequent serovars causing human salmonellosis  $ [46] $  and may be found in human stool samples from Ibadan, Nigeria, if investigated. A plausible explanation for why we could not link any of the serovars obtained from chickens to humans may be due to the analysis of human blood and chicken fecal samples in different years, suggesting time-based shifts in the prevalence of serovars. Analysis of blood samples from only humans could also be responsible because all serovars of NTS are not equally invasive.",

The high level of resistance to nalidixic acid coupled with the high level of reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin is worrisome because fluoroquinolones are strategic in the treatment of invasive salmonellosis  $ [60] $ . The most resistant serovar from chicken was S. Virchow; this serovar is usually multiple resistant to antimicrobials  $ [64,65,69] $ . These observations call for regulation of antibiotic usage in Nigeria to stem the spread of resistance to antimicrobials. The finding of qnrS1 in S. Derby is another public concern because qnr genes mediate resistance to fluoroquinolones, which can compromise treatment with fluoroquinolones  $ [60] $ ; furthermore, qnr location on mobile genetic elements coupled with indiscriminate use of antibiotics in Nigeria will facilitate selection and potential spread to other serovars  $ [70] $ .",
