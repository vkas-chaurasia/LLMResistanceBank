meat) [26], Canary islands (16.5% in chicken meat) [27],
Northwestern Spain (17.9% in chicken) [28], Ethiopia
(17.9% in chicken and giblets) [29], and Egypt (10.0% in
poultry meat) [7]. On the other hand, it was higher than
reported previously in meat products in Egypt (6.6%) and
in ground beef in the United States (4.2%) [30, 31].
In total, _S. enterica_ serovar Typhimurium was the
dominant serovar. These results were in accordance with
previous study from chicken products in Cambodia and
Thailand [32]. Controversially, _S_ . _enterica_ serovar Enteritidis was the dominant serotype in imported frozen
poultry samples from Brazil to Canary Islands and in
chicken carcasses in Spain [27, 28]. _Salmonella enterica_
serovar Kentucky was frequently detected in samples
coming from US to Canary Islands [27].
Prevalence of _E. coli_ in chicken meat and organs was
16.7% which was lower than in Nigeria (43.4%) in frozen poultry meat [33] but higher than in Korea (4.9% in
poultry meat) [34]. Prevalence of _E. coli_ in beef meat was
6.7%, while in Korea and Iran were found 4.1 and 29.0%,
respectively [34, 35].
In this study, 19.0% of _E. coli_ isolates typed as O78 was
mainly from poultry products, while in China, O78 was
identified in 60.0% of _E. coli_ isolated from chicken and
ducks [36]. _E. coli_ type O158 identified in 9.5% only in
beef meat while O158 detected in 22.7% of food isolates
in Chile [37].
Bacterial antimicrobial resistance is a global emerging
problem of public health concern.
In the current study, a high percentage of _S. enterica_
serovars were resistant to ampicillin and cefotaxime.
The resistance to other antimicrobial agents was variable
while all isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol and
ciprofloxacin. The results were in a partial accordance
with results of previous reports stating that all _S. enterica_
isolated from chicken meat and beef were sensitive to
ciprofloxacin [38]. 72.4% of _Salmonella_ isolates in Thai
meat products were resistant to ampicillin while 71.0%
of isolates in Cambodian meat products were resistant
to sulfamethoxazole [32]. Controversially, _S. enterica_ isolated from animals and food of animal origin in Italy were
highly resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline [39] and all _Salmonella_ isolated
from beef in Tunisia were susceptible to amoxicillin and
clavulanic acid [40].
In total, 46.7% of _S. enterica_ serovars showed multidrug
resistance, which was higher than resistance of _Salmo-_
_nella_ isolated from raw chicken (31.0%) in Pennsylvania
during [41]. Less multidrug resistant _S. enterica_ isolates
(6.0%) were identified in cattle hides and carcasses in the
US [42].
The results of this study showed that the antimicrobial resistance of _E. coli_ isolated from poultry was higher



than from beef to the most of tested antibiotics. The
high resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxycillin–
clavulanic acid, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and
streptomycin in this study was in agreement with previous reports conducted in Egypt [10, 43] and Algeria [44].
While in Spain, most of _E. coli_ isolated from diarrhoeic
and healthy lambs were highly resistant to tetracycline
and streptomycin but show lower resistance to ampicillin

[45]. Most of _E. coli_ isolates in this study were sensitive
to enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone which
is in agreement with previous results in Spain [45].
In this study, 61.9% of _E. coli_ isolates were multidrug
resistant. Similar results reported previously in Ghana
and US [23, 46].
Most of the phenotypically antibiotic resistant _S. enter-_
_ica_ serovars carried antibiotic resistance marker genes
associated with β-lactams and quinolones.
The β-lactamase encoding gene _bla_ TEM conferring
resistance to penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins was detected in 73.3% of _S. enterica_ serovars and
in 76.9% of ampicillin-resistant isolates which is significantly high in comparison to 57.3% ( _bla_ TEM-1) in _S. enter-_
_ica_ isolated from retail chickens in China [47]. Another
β-lactamase encoding gene _bla_ CMY-2, an AmpC betalactamase gene that confers resistance to a wide variety
of β-lactam antibiotics detected in 13.3% of isolates. In
contrast, in 4.7% of _S. enterica_ serovars Typhimurium
and Enteritidis originated from diseased broilers in Egypt
_bla_ CMY-2 was identified [48] and all resistant _S. enterica_
serovar Typhimurium isolated from retail meat in US
were harbouring _bla_ CMY [49]. The same gene could not
be detected previously in any _S. enterica_ serovar Typhimurium isolated from chicken meat in Egypt [8].
_bla_ CTX-M could be identified in 73.3% of isolated _S._
enterica serovars. In 24.0 and 18.8% of different _Salmo-_
_nella_ serovars isolated from retail chicken carcasses in
China, _bla_ CTX-M-15 and _bla_ CTX-M-3 were detected, respectively [47].
The _bla_ SHV is responsible for the plasmid-mediated
ampicillin resistance and β-lactamase encoding genes
_bla_ OXA conferring resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin not detected in any of _S. enterica_ serovars in this
study. This result was in accordance with a result for _S._
_enterica_ serovar Typhimurium isolated from chicken
meat in Egypt [8]. In contrast, 30.2% of ESBL-producing
_Salmonella_ isolated from raw chicken carcasses in China
were harbouring _bla_ OXA-1 [47].
Although none of _S. enterica_ serovars were phenotypically resistant to ciprofloxacin _, qnr_ A, _qnr_ B and _qnr_ S
genes were detected in 33.3, 20.0 and 6.7%, respectively in
all _S. enterica_ serovars and in 100, 60.0 and 20.0%, respectively in _S. enterica_ resistant to nalidixic acid. A different
result showed that 1.16% of nalidixic acid-resistant _S._
