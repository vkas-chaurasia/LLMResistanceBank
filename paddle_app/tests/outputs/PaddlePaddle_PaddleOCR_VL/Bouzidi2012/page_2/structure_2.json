Only a few epidemiological studies have been carried out to investigate Salmonella infection risk factors in laying-hen farms. Various risk factors were identified in these studies, including (1) large flocks (Mollenhorst, Van Woudenbergh, Bokkers, & de Boer, 2005; Namata et al., 2008) (2) the age of the sampled hens, older hens being more likely to be contaminated by Salmonella (Castellan et al., 2004; Namata et al., 2008), and (3) inefficient cleaning and disinfection after depopulation for flock renewal (Davies & Breslin, 2003).",

A positive result would not have any adverse consequences. In all, 18 out of 22 layer houses with only one laying flock participated in the study for both years. Two farm owners (representing four layer houses) did not wish to participate. Flock sizes ranged from 2400 to 7200 hens. Pullets were loaded when 18 weeks old. Thirteen flocks comprised Isa Brown hens and five comprised Hy-Line hens. No sign of disease or pathology was found on the farms. Started pullets were typically vaccinated against Newcastle, Marek and Gumboro diseases. None of the sampled flocks was vaccinated against Salmonella. In most cases, owners are not just farmers and consider poultry farming a secondary occupation. The exact number of farmers may therefore fluctuate each year depending on the egg market and feed price.",
