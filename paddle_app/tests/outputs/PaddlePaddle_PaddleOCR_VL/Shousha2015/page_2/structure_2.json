Specialized transduction occurs frequently in the environment during lysogeny, when a prophage incorrectly excises not only its own DNA but also attached bacterial DNA from the host genome. Phages can store this DNA in the capsid, and during the next infection cycle the bacterial host might integrate the foreign DNA by homologous recombination  $ (22) $ . The process has been documented in different environments, such as in environmental water and on plant surfaces  $ (17) $ . New studies, using whole-genome sequencing, have shown that transduction events have occurred in almost every bacterial isolate sequenced  $ (23) $ . In theory, generalized transduction, in which either a virulent or a temperate phage accidentally packs bacterial DNA instead of phage DNA into its capsid and delivers it to the next host, may occur without the need for homologous recombination between different species of bacteria, although there has not yet been any definitive proof of the phenomenon  $ (16) $ . Broad-host-range plasmids have also been transduced between bacteria of nonrelated species  $ (20) $ .",

Our results suggest that the transduction of antimicrobial resistance is not, as has been assumed to date, a rare event but is, rather, more common for certain resistance elements. Phages able to transfer antimicrobial resistance are rather diverse, ranging from host-specific ones to those with a broad host range, and the process is not dependent on homologous recombination. This study raises the question about new strategies in combating the transfer of antimicrobial resistance in the food environment.",
