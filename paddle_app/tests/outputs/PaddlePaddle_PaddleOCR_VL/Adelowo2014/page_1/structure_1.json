Percentage resistance was: tetracycline 81%, sulphamethoxazole 67%, streptomycin 56%, trimethoprim 47%, ciprofloxacin 42%, ampicillin 36%, spectinomycin 28%, nalidixic acid 25%, chloramphenicol 22%, neomycin 14%, gentamicin 8%, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftiofuro, ceftoxime, colistin, florfenicol and apramycin 0%. Resistance genes found among the isolates include bla-TEM (85%), sul2 (67%), sul3 (17%), aadA (65%), strA (70%), strB (61%), catA1 (25%), cmlAI (13%), tetA (21%) and tetB (17%). Class 1 and 2 integrons were found in five (14%) and six (17%) isolates, respectively, while one isolate was positive for both classes of integrons. Seven out of eight isolates with resistance to ciprofloxacin and MIC  $ \\leq $  32 mg/L to nalidixic acid contained qnrS genes.\n\nConclusions: Our findings provided additional evidence that the poultry production environment in Nigeria represents an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes such as qnrS that may spread from livestock production farms to human populations via manure and water.",

Wastes generated on these farms are either dumped in heaps on farmlands or at remote locations, often inside or close to water bodies. Wastes are also used as organic fertilizer or as feed supplements, especially in fish ponds. This raises the fear that human beings resident in the vicinity of the farm and/or animal waste dump may be exposed to antibiotic resistant bacteria in the waste. In addition, close interaction between human and animal ecosystems is a common occurrence in Nigeria with livestock kept in close proximity to or inside human residences. This practice has been shown to favour high rates of transmission of zoonotic E. coli between livestock and humans in rural Uganda [14].
