occurrence of MRS from beef meat is not uncommon ( **Table 6** ).
Raw beef meat sold across the Great Cairo zone, contains 66.7%
of MRS (18/27), with highest prevalence was reported in S. aureus
(6/9, 66.7%), while the MRS non-S. aureus strains 12/18 (66.7%)
from which S. hyicus (6/10, 60%), S. intermedius (1/3, 33.3%), S.
schleiferi subsp. coagulans (4/4, 100%), and S. lentus (1/1, 100%)
were MRS.


Survey of Methicillin, Oxacillin, and
Ciprofloxacin Resistance
As seen in **Table 3**, the distribution of oxacillin among the
non-S. aureus (CNS) isolates was quite broad (14/18, 77.8%).
The overall frequency of ciprofloxacin resistance among nonS. aureus (CNS) was 44.4% (8/18), while that among methicillinresistant non-S. aureus (MRCNS) was 61.1% (11/18), higher,
as expected, than that for methicillin-susceptible non-S. aureus
(MSCNS) 33.3% (6/18). The distribution of S. aureus and
non-S. aureus ciprofloxacin susceptibilities as a function of
methicillin susceptibilities in addition to the mecA resistance
determinant which is responsible for the methicillin resistance,
is recorded in **Table 6** .



DISCUSSION


The non-S. aureus species that have been isolated in the present
investigation were recorded as relevant in their ability to produce
human infections (S. lentus, Stepanovic et al., 2003; S. hyicus,
Casanova et al., 2011; S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, Davis et al.,
2013; and S. intermedius, Koci et al., 2015).
Humans are at a risk of being infected with resistant foodborne bacteria via the food chain (Khan et al., 2000; Pesavento
et al., 2007) from reservoir animals (de Jong et al., 2009; Ewers
et al., 2009; O’Keefe et al., 2010; Marshall and Levy, 2011). A
previous research (Waters et al., 2011) has suggested that, when
buying meat at any butcher shop, supermarket or local grocery
shop, is an equally likely chance of it being contaminated with
drug-resistant bacteria. The WHO has revealed a report on the
global serious threat of antibiotic resistant strains of bacterial
pathogens occurring currently in every locality of the world with
no limitations and to affect everybody, at any age and in any
country (CDC, 2013).
In animals, comparison of resistance rates to antimicrobials
can geographically vary among internationally and nationally
according to the antimicrobial usage regime (Harada and Asai,
