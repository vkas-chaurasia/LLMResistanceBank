**Abstract**
**Background:** The global incidence of foodborne infections and antibiotic resistance is recently increased and con‑
sidered of public health concern. Currently, scarcely information is available on foodborne infections and ESBL associ‑
ated with poultry and beef meat in Egypt.
**Methods:** In total, 180 chicken and beef meat samples as well as internal organs were collected from different
districts in northern Egypt. The samples were investigated for the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of _Salmonella_
_enterica_ serovars and _Escherichia coli_ . All isolates were investigated for harbouring class 1 and class 2 integrons.
**Results:** Out of 180 investigated samples 15 _S. enterica_ (8.3%) and 21 _E. coli_ (11.7%) were isolated and identified.
_S. enterica_ isolates were typed as 9 _S._ Typhimurium (60.0%), 3 _S._ Paratyphi A (20.0%), 2 _S_ . Enteritidis (13.3%) and 1 _S._
Kentucky (6.7%). Twenty-one _E. coli_ isolates were serotyped into O1, O18, O20, O78, O103, O119, O126, O145, O146
and O158. The phenotypic antibiotic resistance profiles of _S. enterica_ serovars to ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime,
trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline were 86.7, 80.0, 60.0, 53.3 and 40.0%, respectively. Isolated _E. coli_
were resistant to tetracycline (80.9%), ampicillin (71.4%), streptomycin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (61.9%
for each) and cefotaxime (33.3%). The dissemination of genes coding for ESBL and AmpC β-lactamase in _S. enterica_
isolates included _bla_ CTX-M (73.3%), _bla_ TEM (73.3%) and _bla_ CMY (13.3%). In _E. coli_ isolates _bla_ TEM, _bla_ CTX-M and _bla_ OXA were
identified in 52.4, 42.9 and 14.3%, respectively. The plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes identified in _S._
_enterica_ were _qnr_ A (33.3%), _qnr_ B (20.0%) and _qnr_ S (6.7%) while _qnr_ A and _qnr_ B were detected in 33.3% of _E. coli_ isolates.
Class 1 integron was detected in 13.3% of _S. enterica_ and in 14.3% of _E. coli_ isolates. Class 2 integron as well as the
colistin resistance gene _mcr_ -1 was not found in any of _E. coli_ or _S. enterica_ isolates.
**Conclusions:** This study showed high prevalence of _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ as foodborne pathogens in raw chicken and
beef meat in Nile Delta, Egypt. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ isolates is of public
health concern in Egypt. Molecular biological investigation elucidated the presence of genes associated with antibi‑
otic resistance as well as class 1 integron in _S. enterica_ and _E. coli_ .
