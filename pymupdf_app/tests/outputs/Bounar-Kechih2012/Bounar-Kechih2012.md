**ABSTRACT** This study aims at identifying serotypes
and surveying the antimicrobial resistance and plasmid
support of resistance of 100 _Salmonella_ strains, which
were isolated from 96 out of 506 (18.97%) samples taken from different production farms in the wilayas (i.e.,
Algerian states) of Tizi-Ouzou, Bouira, Bejaïa, and
Boumerdes in 2007. The highest percentage of _Salmo-_
_nella_ (48%) was recorded in Bouira. Thirteen serotypes
were identified among the 100 _Salmonella_ strains used
in this study. The most prevalent ones were _Salmonella_
Heidelberg (24%), _Salmonella_ Enteritidis (20%), _Sal-_
_monella_ Albany (16%), and _Salmonella_ Typhimurium
(9%). The strains showed resistance to 8 of the 34 antibiotics tested. Fifty-three percent of strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic, among which 15.09%
were multiresistant. The most frequently observed resistance was to quinolones (58.49%), with a contribution



of 94.74% of _Salmonella_ Heidelberg resistant strains.
The plasmid transfer performed on 53 strains showed
that only 11 exhibited one or more markers of resistance, the most frequent being ampicillin, followed by
tetracycline, then cotrimoxazole, sulphonamides, and
kanamycin, in that order. The tetracycline characteristics were present in 72.72% of transconjugants, those of
the β-lactams and sulphonamides in 27.27% each and
those of the aminosides in 9.09%. The incompatibility groups of plasmids belong to the F1me and Com1
classes, and the molecular weight of the plasmid DNA
was greater than 100 kb. The phenotypic and genotypic results indicate a clonal dissemination in the _Gallus_
_gallus_ species in this particular study; this phenomenon
could generate resistant bacteria and transferable genes
of resistance to humans.

**INTRODUCTION**

The production and consumption of poultry has increased considerably worldwide. Poultry production
has left the farmyard and is now industrialized and conducted in a more rational manner (Delpech, 1992). In
Algeria, since the 1980s, the emergence of the poultry
industries increased the consumption of animal proteins
at a much affordable cost (Ferrah et al., 2003). Poultry represents one of the main reservoirs of _Salmonella_
that are responsible for a major zoonosis with serious
economic and public health consequences (Brisabois,
2001). Antimicrobial agents played a dominant role
for the treatment and the control of the salmonellosis.
Their overconsumption contributed to the emergence
of resistances. In fact, despite the decrease of salmonellosis incidence in the world, multiresistant strains

appeared in humans and became increasingly alarming
in both industrialized and developing countries (Brisabois, 2001). The surveillance of the current bacterial resistances should not be exclusively based on the
determination of the resistant phenotypes. The genetic
characterization by conjugation is currently the most
used tool in Algeria to better understand the spread
of antibiotic resistance in zoonotic bacteria, until the
introduction of molecular biology techniques.
Our objectives were the phenotypic characterization
of 100 _Salmonella_ strains by determining the circulating
serotypes in the study’s area, the antimicrobial resistance profiles, as well as the genotypic characterization.


**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

_**Sampling**_

As part of official control of poultry in 4 wilayas of
Algeria, from January to December 2007, 100 _Salmo-_
_nella_ strains were isolated from 506 avian samples during autopsies of slain live subjects. This was conducted

at the medical bacteriology department of the Regional
Veterinary Laboratory of Draa-Ben-Khedda.


_**Isolation and Identification**_
_**of Salmonella Strains**_

The NF U 47–100/2007 (Afnor, 2007) standard method was adopted for the isolation and the biochemical
and serological identification of _Salmonella._ The serotyping was carried out at the enterobacteria service of
the Institut Pasteur of Algeria, using _Salmonella_ antiserums anti-O and anti-H (BioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile,
France).


_**Antimicrobial Sensitivity Testing**_

The phenotypic study of the antimicrobial resistance
was performed at the Bacteriology and Antibiotherapy
Department of the Institut Pasteur of Algeria. Thirtyfour antimicrobial agents of 9 different chemical classes
were used: ampicillin (10 μg), amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid (20 μg/10 μg), mecillinam (10 μg), ticarcillin (75
μg), piperacillin (100 μg), latamoxef (30 μg), imepenem (10 μg), aztreonam (30 μg), cefazolin (30 μg), cefalexin (30 μg), cefoxitin (30 μg), ceftazidim (30 μg),
cefepim (30 μg), cefuroxim (30 μg), cefotaxim (30 μg),
to ceftiofur (30 μg), cephalotin (30 μg), gentamicin (10
μg), amikacin (30 μg), netilmicin (30 μg), kanamycin
(30 μg), isepamicin (30 μg), nitrofurantoїne (300 μg),
nalidixic acid (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), enrofloxacin (5 μg), levofloxacin (5 μg), tetracyclines (30 μg),
chloramphenicol (30 μg), sulphonamides (300 μg),
trimethoprim (5 μg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(1.25 μg/23.75 μg), colistin (10 μg), and fosfomycin
(200 μg; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Micrograms indicates
the antibiotic load in one disk; the unit of this load (expressed in micrograms) for each antibiotic used for each
bacterial species is specified by the supplier (Bio-Rad).
The minimum inhibitory concentration was established
using the E-test (AB-Biodisk). _Escherichia coli_ ATCC
25922 (Institut Pasteur Paris, Paris, France) was used
for the control antibiograms. The method adopted for
the study of the antimicrobial resistance is based on
the diffusion in Mueller-Hinton agar media as described
by Kirby-Bauer and interpreted according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2001) guidelines, which are recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO, 1999). In our study, the multiresistant strains are the ones that confer a resistance to
2 or more antimicrobials. The study of genetic support
required the use of antimicrobial powders: tetracycline
(Sigma, Woodstock, VA), nalidixic acid (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), rifampicin (Life-pharmacy, Tuen
Mun, Hong Kong, China), nitrofurantoїnes (Saïdal,
Annaba, Algeria), kanamycin (Bristol-Meyers Squibb,
New York, NY), trimethoprim (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), injectable sodic ampicillin (Biopharm, Bothell,
WA), chloramphenicol sodic ampicillin (Serva Peinbiochemica). Also, several reference strains and plasmids



were used (Institut Pasteur Paris): _Escherichia coli_
K12Nal (nalidixic acid resistance) and _Escherichia coli_
C600Rif (rifampicin resistance) for the plasmid transfer by conjugation and Com1 (K) Rif, Com1 PPED
178 (ACTp) Rif, F1me PPED 181/4(T) Nal, and F1me
PPED 181/3(CTp) Rif for the compatibility test, as
well as the DNA of the λ phage digested by the Hind
III enzyme as a reference to determine the size of the
plasmids. The genetic transfer by conjugation that
was used for the detection of plasmids carrying the resistance characters was described by Courvalin et al.
(1985). After streaking on agar bromocresol purple and
18 to 24 h of incubation at 35°C, a colony of the studied
donor strain and that of the recipient reference strain
were individually inoculated in buffered glucose broth.
After shaking for 4 h in a water bath at 35°C, 1 mL of
each culture was mixed with a rake on Mueller-Hinton
agar and incubated for 18 h at 35°C. One milliliter of
buffered glucose broth was added, and then the supernatant was recovered after mixing. Moreover, 1 mL of
an antibiotic for the suspected plasmidic character for
the donor strain and 1 mL of another antibiotic for
the suspected chromosomal character for the receiving
strain were added to 18 mL of Mueller-Hinton agar.
The final concentrations of the antibiotics used are Furans, 300 μg/mL; TCY, 33 μg/mL; ampicillin, 200 μg/
mL; kanamycine, 25 μg/mL; Nal, 100 μg/mL; TMP, 20
μg/mL; CCC, 25 μg/mL. A quarter of a Petri dish was
seeded in lines by the 2 strains and the 3/4 remaining
were streaked by the supernatant (mixture of these 2
strains). After 18 h of incubation at 35°C, the appearance of colonies on the part inoculated with the supernatant indicates the presence of the transconjugants.
The resulting transconjugants were tested to determine their resistance profiles and therefore their transferable characteristics. To determine the major incompatibility groups of plasmids the used test was the same
as for the genetic transfer; it required a cross between
a transconjugant and _E. coli_ carrying a plasmid reference. The plasmids were extracted from the transferred
strains and their transconjugants, using the alkaline
lyse technique (Kado and Liu, 1981), and the plasmid
profiles were determined by separating the plasmids extracted on agarose gel.


**RESULTS**

Nineteen percent of the total samples were positive
for _Salmonella_ . The distribution of _Salmonella_ per wilaya showed 48% of cases from Bouira, 21% from Bejaïa,
16% from Boumerdes, and 15% from Tizi-Ouzou. Thirteen different serotypes were identified, among which
_Salmonella_ Heidelberg was the most prevalent (24%).
_Salmonella_ Heidelberg, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, _Salmo-_
_nella_ Albany, _Salmonella_ Infantis, _Salmonella_ Blockley, and _Salmonella_ Livingstone were present in all the
wilayas. Besides, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis prevailed in
Bouira, _Salmonella_ Albany in Bejaïa and Tizi-Ouzou,
and _Salmonella_ Heidelberg in Boumerdes (Table 1).




ANTIBIOGRAM AND PLASMID PROFILES OF _SALMONELLA_ 1181



The study of the antimicrobial resistance performed
on 100 _Salmonella_ strains revealed a resistance to 8
of them from 6 different classes. Fifty-three percent
of the strains showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial, among which 15.09% were multiresistant.
Forty-seven percent of strains were susceptible to all
antimicrobials tested. The resistance to quinolones was
the most frequent (58.49%) and included 94.74% of the
resistant strains of the prevalent serotype in our study
(Table 2). The plasmid transfer assay was performed
on 53 strains with resistance to β-lactams (4%), aminoglycosides (2%), tetracyclines (15%), sulphonamides
(13%), nitrofurans (19%), and to quinolones (47%). In
total, 11 strains have transferred one or several resistance markers, of which the most frequent were ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, sulphonamides, and
kanamycin. The tetracycline character was present in
72.72% of transconjugants, those of the sulphonamides
and β-lactams in 27.27% each, and that of the aminoglycosides in 9.09%. The compatibility test revealed
incompatibility groups of plasmids in Com1 and F1me
classes (Table 3). The plasmid DNA analysis resulted
in a molecular weight that is greater than 100 kb (Figure 1).


**DISCUSSION**

_**Geographical Distribution**_
_**of Salmonella Serotypes**_

Bouira was characterized by the most important
number of isolated strains because most avian samples
were from this region, which has more than one-thousand poultry farms. _Salmonella_ Heidelberg prevailed in
our study. Our results were supported by the study
of Barnhart et al. (1991) in Northern Ireland, on 42
poultry samples (56.5%), and that of Mammina et al.
(2003) in Italy, on laying hens and the environment of
chicken farms (20.3%). Whereas in a national study,



_Salmonella_ Heidelberg represents only 1.81% (Elgroud
et al., 2009). This serotype is among the 3 most common cases of human salmonellosis in Canada and one
of the 5 most prevalent in the USA, according to the
Canadian integrated program for monitoring of the
antimicrobial resistance (PICRA, 2006). According to
this program, international comparisons of human data
from 2000 to 2004 indicated that _Salmonella_ Heidelberg
was more common in North America, whereas Mammina et al. (2003) have shown that this serotype was
responsible for only a small proportion of human infection in Italy. According to Usera et al. (1999) and
the report of the European Community (EFSA, 2007),
_Salmonella_ Enteritidis was the most frequently reported, with prevalences of 46.1 and 42%, respectively, and
these are higher than those we have recorded. Our present result is higher than that recorded by Elgroud et
al. (2008; 3.63%). The isolation frequency of _Salmonella_
Infantis and _Salmonella_ Albany was comparable to that
given in Austria by Berghold and Kornschober (2002).
Similarly, the rate that we recorded for _Salmonella_
Typhimurium was comparable to that reported by Elgroud et al. (2009) and by Van Immerseel et al. (2005)
in poultry farms in Europe between 1991 and 2000 but
higher than that noted by these same authors in 2003.
The registered prevalence for _Salmonella_ Blockley was
lower than that found in Saudi Arabia (al-Nakhli et
al., 1999). _Salmonella_ Hadar, identified in 5% of our
strains, was the predominant serotype in Italy (Uyttendaele et al., 1998) and Senegal (Cardinale et al., 2005).
_Salmonella_ Pullorum, which has no impact on public
health, as related to host species has been eradicated
from poultry farms in several developed countries, such
as the USA and Canada. The declaration of pullorosis
in our farms could cause major economic losses, such as
those observed from the thirties to the sixties (Villate,
2001). In our study, _Salmonella_ Newport and _Salmonel-_
_la_ Montevideo were isolated with a very low prevalence.
These results are corroborated by the study of Elgroud

et al. (2009) but refuted by those of Uyttendaele et
al. (1998) in Belgium and Foley et al. (2008) in the
USA, who have ranked it among the 6 most common
serotypes. The study of the distribution of _Salmonella_
serotypes within 4 wilayas taught us about their dynamic expansion across the adjacent wilayas, or even
their possible spread in the national territory. Bouira
was the wilaya that counted most of the serotypes, with
a high prevalence of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, _Salmonella_
Heidelberg, and _Salmonella_ Typhimurium. Bejaïa had
less diversity than that recorded in Bouira; the predominant serotypes were _Salmonella_ Albany, _Salmo-_
_nella_ Heidelberg, and _Salmonella_ Infantis. Although
Tizi-Ouzou and Boumerdes had only 15 and 16 strains,
diversity was observed with a predominance of _Salmo-_
_nella_ Albany and _Salmonella_ Heidelberg, respectively.
The homogeneous distribution of all serotypes in the
study’s area could be the consequence of the uncontrolled movement of poultry products.


_**Resistance of Antimicrobial Agents Tested**_

There is a positive correlation between antimicrobial
use and bacterial resistance rates; indeed, each expo


sure eliminates the susceptible bacteria and promotes
the growth of resistant strains (Jaecklin, 2002; Fluit,
2005). Even though the treatment of avian salmonellosis is banned in Algeria by ministerial order (JORA,
2003), the high rate of antimicrobial resistance that we
recorded (53%) could be explained by the indiscriminate use of these drugs for therapeutic, prophylactic
purposes or as growth promoters. Our result was significantly higher than that reported by Al-Bahry et al.
(2007; 23.7%) and lower than that recorded by Elgroud
et al. (2008; 80%) and that reported by the PICRA
(2006; 63%). Multidrug resistance observed in our study
was also described by Bornert (2000) and Al-Bahry et
al. (2007). Moreover, resistance was found for 6 of the
9 antimicrobial classes tested. The observed resistance
to first generation quinolones (nalidixic acid) was the
most frequent. This is likely due to their repeated use in
poultry production. Fortunately, there is no resistance
to fluoroquinolones tested (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin,
levofloxacin) as reported by Mc Kenzie and Nadeau
(2006). These results corroborate several international
studies (Heurtin-Le Corre et al. 1999; San Martin et al.,
2005; PICRA, 2006). _Salmonella_ isolates were found to
be resistant to ciprofloxacin in previous French (Brisabois et al., 1997) and Algerian studies (Elgroud et al.,
2009; Bouzidi et al., 2011), which is more worrying as
fluoroquinolones should be reserved for the treatment
of invasive human salmonellosis (Davies et al., 1999).
Although furans have been removed from the Algerian
nomenclature, we recorded a high rate of resistance to
nitrofurantoїnes. This result was lower than that noted in 2004 in Poland by Wasyl and Hoszowski (2004;
48.2%). The rates of resistance to cyclines reported by
several authors were higher than those we recorded and
ranged from 20 to 91% (Brisabois et al., 1997; Dinh
Nam Lâm et al., 2000; Mc Kenzie and Nadeau, 2006;
PICRA, 2006). As for sulphonamides, our result was
higher than that reported by the national monitoring network to antimicrobial resistance (7%; Aboun,
2005) and lower than that noted by Brisabois et al.

(1997; 88%). Resistance to β-lactams involved ampicillin only; our result was lower than those reported by
Mc Kenzie and Nadeau (2006), Al-Bahry et al. (2007),
and Dinh Nam Lâm et al. (2000), which were between
36 and 88.89%. Acquired resistance to aminoglycosides
is not common in _Enterobacteriaceae_ (Courvalin and
Philippon, 1989); the only restraint in our study was
resistance to kanamycin, although this antimicrobial
agent is not used in poultry. Our result, probably due
to the cross resistance with neomycin, was in agreement with those obtained by Brisabois et al. (1997),
Millemann (1998), Dinh Nam Lâm et al. (2000), and
Mc Kenzie and Nadeau (2006). The susceptibility to
polypeptides was confirmed by Aboun (2005); on the
other hand, the susceptibility to chloramphenicol was
reversed by Brisabois et al. (1997), Dinh Nam Lâm et
al. (2000), and Al-Bahry et al. (2007), who noted 91,
25, and 14% resistance rates, respectively. Out of 24
_Salmonella_ Heidelberg strains tested, only 5 were susceptible to all antimicrobials used. The 19 remaining
were mostly resistant to nalidixic acid. In Canada, this
serotype would be particularly resistant to the third
generation cephalosporins (PICRA, 2006). The resistance of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis to furans was confirmed
by the results of Espigares et al. (2006). In our study,
_Salmonella_ Typhimurium was resistant to quinolones,
furans, cyclones, and sulphonamides. This multidrug
resistance could facilitate the spread of this serotype
and the development of other mechanisms of resistance
to other antimicrobial classes. Indeed, in the literature,
_Salmonella_ Typhimurium was resistant to several antimicrobial agents with a special surge of resistance to
nalidixic acid (Brisabois et al. 1997; Heurtin-Le Corre
et al., 1999). _Salmonella_ Hadar, resistant to quinolones
and tetracycline, was multiresistant in the study of Espigares et al. (2006).


_**Genetic Support of Resistance**_

The _Salmonella_ strains resistant to nalidixic acid and
nitrofurantoїnes were not transferable, confirming the
chromosomal support of these resistances. The majority of resistance markers were transferred; the most
common were ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole,
sulphonamides, and kanamycin. In our study, a plasmid
grouping identified the same classes (Com1 and F1me)
as described by Chaslus-Dancla (1980) in France and
found in a national study on enterobacteria isolated in
western Algeria (Barka, 2002). The results obtained by
physical analysis of plasmid content of transconjugants
implied that the spread of resistance characteristics of
studied _Salmonella_ strains is provided by high molecular weight plasmids. This study allowed us to highlight
diverse serotypes, with a predominance of _Salmonella_
Heidelberg. The free flow of the same _Salmonella_ serotypes and the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance
and plasmid groups, observed in a limited area of study,
is an alarming reality. The fight against avian salmonellosis requires the application of control measures at



various levels of the production chain. It would also
require the development of an effective plan of epidemiological surveillance, and for this, similar and complementary studies must be conducted in Algeria and
will include the identification of different phage types
and their distribution, monitoring the geographical
spread and resistance evolution of identified serotypes,
the spread of resistant _Salmonella_ strains from animals
to humans, and the identification of resistance genes.
The use of different techniques in molecular biology is
essential, particularly those based on the analysis of the
restriction pattern of plasmids should be generalized.
