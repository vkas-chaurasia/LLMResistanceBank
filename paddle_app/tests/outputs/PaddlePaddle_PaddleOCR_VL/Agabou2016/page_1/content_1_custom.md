## Abstract
 The objectives of this study were to determine rates, patterns, and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and to assess connections between chicken commensal, human commensal, and pathogenic ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates. All E. coli isolates collected from chickens, their farmers, and patients in the Constantine region (North-east Algeria) were analyzed for bla and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene contents, phylogroups, Rep-PCR profiles, and multilocus sequence types. A high prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones (51.4 % to ciprofloxacin) was recorded in avian isolates. Of these, 22.2 % carried the  $ aac(6')-Ib-cr $  gene, whereas lower resistance levels to these antibiotics were recorded in chicken farmers' isolates. None of the commensal isolates harbored the qnr, qepA, or oqxAB genes. One human pathogenic isolate was ertapenem-resistant and harbored the  $ bla_{OXA-48} $  gene, 84 showed an extended-spectrum  $ \beta $ -lactamase phenotype, with

bla $ _{CTX-M-15} $  gene prevalent in 87.2% of them. Seventy isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, with  $ aac(6')-Ib-cr $  present in 72.8%, qnrB in 5.7%, and qnrS in 10%. Three Rep-PCR profiles were common to chicken commensal and human pathogenic isolates (phylogroups D and B1; ST21, ST48, and ST471 respectively); one was found in both chicken and chicken-farmer commensal strains (D; ST108), while another profile was identified in a chicken-farmer commensal strain and a human pathogenic one (B1; ST19). These findings suggest clonal and epidemiologic links between chicken and human ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates and the important role that poultry may play in the epidemiology of human E. coli infections in the Constantine region.

## I ntroduction

Escherichia coli are commensal bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many animal species. However, some strains are pathogenic and frequently encountered in clinical practice. In poultry production, colibacillosis (caused by avian pathogenic  $ E.\ coli $ : APEC) continues to be a devastating disease all over the world.

Antimicrobial therapy is an important tool to reduce both the incidence of this pathology and its economic impact  $ [1] $ . Nevertheless, used therapeutically or given subtherapeutically as feed additives, antibiotics seem to have a profound impact on the development of antibiotic resistance in commensal bacteria, which are potential genetic partners in the transfer of resistance genes to pathogenic ones  $ [2, 3] $ . Over many years, the multiplication of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in animals has become a major concern in both animal and public health, as resistant bacteria can pass through the food chain to people  $ [4] $ . In several surveys, the use of antibiotics in animal production has been held responsible for the
