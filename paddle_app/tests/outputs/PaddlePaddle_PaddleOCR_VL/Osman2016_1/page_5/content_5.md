important antimicrobials was also observed. The antimicrobial resistance profile of the 50 isolated Staphylococcus spp to different antibiotics was analyzed; none of the isolates were totally sensitive to the 12 tested antibiotics and 16/50 of the isolates were shown to be resistant to at least 3 antibiotics (S. lugdunensis) representing three classes. A small percentage of the isolates (less than 50%) demonstrated resistance to oxacillin, methicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and tetracycline (Table 2). Also resistant to  $ \beta $ -lactams, such as ampicillin (6/50), penicillin (22/50), methicillin (8/50), and oxacillin (13/50) was evident (Table 2). Forty seven out of the fifty isolates were resistant to penicillin and tetracycline.

## The Distribution of Antibiotic Resistance Ratios of the Staphylococcus (S) Coagulase Positive (CP)-Negative (CN) That Are Resistant (MR) and Susceptible to Methicillin (MS)

Methicillin resistance in CPS and CNS was calculated to be 64.3 and 52.8%, respectively. The antimicrobial resistance patterns of the isolates are shown in Table 3. The resistance ratios to clindamycin, methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in CPS and to clindamycin, gentamycin, methicillin, oxacillin and penicillin in CNS were found to be higher in the methicillin-resistant isolates compared to those that were susceptible to methicillin (p < 0.001). The lowest resistance ratio in the methicillin-resistant staphylococci was detected for ciprofloxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam in the CPS and to ampicillin-sulbactam, chloramphenicol and

ciprofloxacin in the CNS. A comparison of the resistance patterns revealed that all isolates from chickens showed resistance from three to nine classes of antimicrobial agents (Table 4).

Eight isolates showed resistance to oxacillin, undetectable by mecA amplification. The three S. aureus isolates were resistant to 9–10 antimicrobials (Table 4). Two unique susceptibility profiles were identified among the S. aureus isolates, with many resistant
