may also be sources of contamination, as well as coughing
and sneezing by individuals with respiratory infections
(McEntire, 2004). S. aureus contaminations are often associated with institutions such as hospitals, schools, and prisons, where food is often prepared in mass quantities and held
until consumption (McEntire, 2004). Lack of sanitation by
workers and improper time–temperature combinations during storage can lead to contamination of the product and
growth of the microorganism to levels at which toxin is
produced (McEntire, 2004).
Podkowik et al. (2012) showed that raw chicken and beef
meat are an important source of CNS and that they received
increasing attention due to their potential role in the dissemination of antibiotic-resistance markers in the community and
imply food-safety hazards. The antimicrobial resistance profile of the tested CPS and CNS isolates to different antibiotics
is recorded in Table 1. All investigated CPS and CNS isolates
were resistant to at least one antibiotic. A high overall resistance to antibiotics was observed, again possibly from using
antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed (Wise, 2007),
especially those commonly used for both human and animal
care, which should consequently be avoided. Antimicrobial
resistance was mainly against penicillin (94%), clindamycin
(90%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (82%). Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus showed intermediate resistance
(51%), which might indicate the dissemination of vancomycin resistance in the community and imply food-safety
hazards (Martins et al., 2013). The percentage of resistance to
b-lactams was variable, with the highest resistance being to
penicillin (94%) and lowest to ampicillin-sulbactam (22%).
CNS are more resistant than S. aureus and may be a source of
b-lactam resistance genes (de Medeiros et al., 2011).
These findings highlight the high potential risk for consumers in the absence of strict hygienic and preventative
measures to avoid the presence of CPS and CNS isolates in
foods. Emphasis should be placed on implementing The



Codex Alimentarius Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat
(CHPM), which includes the primary international standard
for meat hygiene and incorporates a risk-based approach to
application of sanitary measures throughout the meat production chain (OIE, 2014). Also, contamination during the
distribution and consumption of the final food products must
be taken into account. In addition, the potential trade impacts
of beef meat garners attention to the multidrug-resistant
characteristics of the isolated CPS and CNS and their possible
international spread, which poses a threat to public health
through their ability to be transferred to humans. Our results
show the need for and importance of improving monitoring
data and global cooperation in controlling food contamination, raising the sense of urgency to prevent a more threatening drug-resistant bacteria from emerging and unleashing a
pandemic. Our findings also provide useful information for
public health projects in Egypt, and indicate that the implementation of the Codex Committee on Food Import and
Export Inspection and Certification Systems (CCFICS) and
the OIE Handbook on Import Risk Analysis for Animals and
Animal Products publication, which provide guidelines useful to bilateral parties to develop principles and guidelines in
this area, has become a must and that food control should
cover both export and import.
