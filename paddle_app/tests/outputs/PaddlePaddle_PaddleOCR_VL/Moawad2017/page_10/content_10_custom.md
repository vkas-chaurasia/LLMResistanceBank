enterica serovars isolated from animal products in Tunisia carried qnr gene  $ [50] $ . In other studies in China qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes detected with low percentage in S. enterica serovar Enteritidis isolated from retail raw poultry  $ [51, 52] $ .

The  $ bla_{TEM} $  gene was detected in 52.3% of all isolated E. coli and in 73.3% of ampicillin-resistant isolates. Other studies detected  $ bla_{TEM} $  in 97.1 and 75.0% of E. coli isolates from lambs in Spain and meat products in Cambodia, respectively [32, 45]. In China,  $ bla_{TEM} $  was identified in 7.8% of ESBL-producing E. coli recovered from meat products [53].

The  $ \beta $ -lactamase encoding gene  $ bla_{CMY} $  was not found in any of the isolated E. coli. In contrast,  $ bla_{CMY-2} $  was detected in 89.0% E. coli isolated from poultry meat in Denmark [54] and in 12.5% of ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from meat products in Cambodia [32].

The  $ bla_{CTX-M} $  detected in 42.9% of E. coli isolated in this study. In Ghana 50.0% of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from meat harboured  $ bla_{CTX-M} $  [46] while these  $ \beta $ -lactamase encoding genes  $ bla_{CTX-M-15} $  and  $ bla_{CTX-M-9} $  were detected rarely (1.6%) in E. coli isolates from meat products in China [53].

The  $ bla_{SHV} $  gene was not found in any of the E. coli isolates. Controversially, previous studies detected  $ bla_{SHV} $  in 9.4, 5.3 and 2.0% in meat products in China, broiler chickens and chicken carcasses in Iran, respectively [53, 55, 56].

bla $ _{OXA-1} $  was detected in 14.3% of the E. coli isolates which is in contrast with previous report conducted in retail meat in US where the gene could not be identified [23].

The most common carbapenemase types were blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-48 accounting for 47% of all identified carbapenemase genes  $ [25, 57] $ . In this study, blaOXA-23 was not identified in all isolated strains.

In isolated E. coli, qnrA and qnrB detected in 33.3% of isolates, all nalidixic acid and/or ciprofloxacin resistant isolates harboured both genes. While qnrB and qnrS were identified in 10.4% of nalidixic acid resistant E. coli isolated from Algerian retail chicken meat  $ [44] $  and in 10.0% of E. coli isolates obtained from bovine carcasses in Mexico  $ [58] $ . In contrast, qnrA, qnrB and qrnS genes could not be identified in enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli strains from poultry in Mexico  $ [59] $ .

The presence of genetic elements such as integrons and transposons are often associated with multi-resistant phenotypes among Salmonella isolates  $ [60] $ . In this study, class 1 integron detected in 13.3% of S. enterica serovars. The identified gene cassettes were dfrA15, dfrA17 and aadA2. In previous studies, class 1 integron identified in 90.0% of multi-drug resistant Salmonella isolates from retail chicken meat in Japan and the identified genes cassettes were dfrA1, dfrA7, aadA1, aadB, and catB3  $ [61, 62] $ . The gene cassettes of class 1 integron which detected in Salmonella spp. isolated from poultry meat in Egypt were harbouring aac (3)-Id, aadA2, aadA4, aadA7, sat, dfrA15, lnuF and estX resistance genes  $ [7] $ . In a study conducted in Portugal, 75.0% of S. enterica isolated from different sources including food products had one or two class 1 integrons  $ [63] $ .



The identified gene cassettes of class 1 integron dfrA1, dfrA15 and dfrA1-orf which confer resistance to trimethoprim were identified in 14.3% of E. coli isolated in this study. This is in agreement with E. coli isolates from retail chickens in Japan  $ [62] $  and in 1.9 and 11.4% of isolates from Thai and Cambodian meat samples obtained from slaughterhouses and fresh markets and the most common gene cassette was dfrA12-aadA2  $ [32] $ .

Class 2 integrons were not detected in all isolates of this study which is in contrast to 5.6% positive samples in Egypt  $ [10] $ .

In this study, mcr-1 gene associated with colistin resistance was neither detected in S. enterica nor E. coli isolates. This result was in agreement with the result reported by Doumith et al. [64] who investigated 24,000 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from food and humans including S. enterica and E. coli and found only 15 mcr-1 positive isolates. Recently, Quesada et al. identified the gene mcr-1 in nine S. enterica and E. coli isolates from poultry and swine for the first time in Spain [65]. Jayol et al. found the mcr-1 in 13% of E. coli and S. enterica [66]. Considering the frequent use of colistin in animal production and the importance of this antimicrobial for the control of multi-resistant Gram-negative nosocomial infections in humans, monitoring the dissemination of resistance to colistin is mandatory.

In conclusion, the results of this study showed high prevalence of  $ S.\ enterica $  and  $ E.\ coli $  as foodborne pathogens isolated from poultry and beef meat in Egypt. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance of  $ S.\ enterica $  and  $ E.\ coli $  isolates is of public concerns in Egypt. Significant resistance was detected to penicillin, cephalosporins, tetracycline and sulphonamides. Dissemination of ESBL and AmpC- $ \beta $ -lactamase resistance-associated genes in  $ S.\ enterica $  and  $ E.\ coli $  was determined. Presence of class 1 integron in  $ S.\ enterica $  and  $ E.\ coli $  and genes associated with antibiotic resistance was also confirmed. Class 2 integron was not detected in any isolate. Further work should be performed to characterize  $ S.\ enterica $  and  $ E.\ coli $  isolates of animal and human origin from the same region sharing the same resistance markers in order to highlight potential horizontal gene transfer by these zoonotic organisms.
