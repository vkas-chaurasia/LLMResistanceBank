aBacteria were grown in brain heart infusion broth overnight and loaded onto Vero cell monolayers. After 2 days of incubation at 35◦C in 95% air and 5% CO2, the cells were examined
microscopically for morphological changes. Cell lysis was indicated by Vero cell destruction. Cell rounding indicated Vero cells detached from the plastic cultural surface and floating in
the cell culture medium.

biofilm producer (77.8%). Generally, the 20 vancomycin resistant
S. aureus and non-S. aureus species were also biofilm producers.
The affinity of the 27 Staphylococcus species to form a biofilm was
found to be in favor of the glass surface by 88.9% (24/27).


Tube Method
The qualitative tube adherence test depends on the visual
assessment of the degree of adherence of Staphylococcus isolates
to the sides of borosilicate test tubes. The 27 Staphylococcus
isolates were screened for biofilm formation by tube method.
Results of the screening for biofilm by the tube method is shown
in **Table 2** . Out of the 27 Staphylococcus isolates, 24 (88.9%)
were strongly positive to the ability of biofilm formation, while
3 (11.1%) were negative to biofilm formation. Biofilm formation
affinity was observed in the nine S. aureus isolates (100%) and
15/18 in the non-S. aureus isolates (83.3%).


Congo Red Agar Method
Among the 27 Staphylococcus isolates, 11 (40.7 %) showed black
colonies with dry crystalline consistency which is indicative of
slime production whereas 16 (59.3 %) isolates showed pink
colored colonies with mucoid appearance on the CRA plates
which were taken as negative for slime production ( **Table 2** ).
Ability to produce slime was evident in 4/9 (44.4%) of the
S. aureus and 7/18 (38.9%) of the non-S. aureus isolates. The
studies on slime formation by the non-S. aureus species of
medical importance revealed that S. hyicus, S. schleiferi subsp.
Coagulans, and S. intermedius showed that up to 30% (3/10),
75% (3/4) and 33.3% (1/3), respectively, of these species produced
slime, while S. lentus (1/1) was unable to produce slime.


Antibiotic Resistance Phenotypes for All
Staphylococci
The phenotypic resistance pattern, prevalence and diversity of
the 27 Staphylococcus species isolated from the beef meat are



recorded in **Table 3** . The 27 Staphylococcus species were resistant
to the 12 antibiotics with variable degrees as to each of the
antibiotics used as indicated in **Table 3** to reveal in ascending
order: ampicillin-sulbactam 14.8% (4/27), chloramphenicol
29.6% (8/27), erythromycin 48.1% (13/27), ciprofloxacin 59.3%
(16/27), methicillin 63% (17/27), tetracycline 66.7% (18/27),
vancomycine 74.1% (20/27), oxacillin 77.8% (21/27), penicillin
92.6% (25/27), clindamycin 96.3% (26/27), gentamycin 96.3%
(26/27), and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim 100% (27/27).
The different Staphylococcus species also reflect a difference
in their antibiotic resistance to the 12 antibiotics each species
with a different capacity to resistance: S. lentus 91.7% (11/12),
S. aureus 77.8% (84/108), S. intermedius 72.2% (26/36),
S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans 70.8% (34/48), and S. hyicus 55%
(66/120).
The several MDR combination patterns are recorded in
**Table 4** . The Table reveals, that there were 21 different
combination patterns ranging from four to twelve antibiotics
in each combination. Out of the 27 Staphylococcus isolates only
one isolate was resistant to the 12 antibiotics representing nine
classes. This isolate was one of the nine S. aureus isolates
( **Table 5** ). The Table also reveals the wide dispersity in the
number of antibiotic combinations in each isolate and species
of the staphylococci isolates (S. aureus, five combinations;
S. hyicus, five combinations; S. intermedius, three combinations;
S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans two combinations; and S. lentus, one
combination).


Widespread Distribution of Antibiotic
Resistance Genes among Staphylococcal
Isolates
We screened the meat Staphylococcus isolates for the presence
of the multiple resistance genes mecA, cfr, gyrA, gyrB, and grlA
genes among Staphylococci isolated from beef meat in Egypt.
