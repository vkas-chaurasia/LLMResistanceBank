Resistance to erythromycin and amoxicillin, two antibiotics widely used to treat illness in Cˆote d’Ivoire, is not negligible. However, rates of that resistance are lower compared
to those obtained with the fluoroquinolones.
These results are similar to previous observations [19,
20, 45–48]. The relatively high percentages of resistance to
most antimicrobial agents tested in our study may be due to
high usage of these agents as growth promoters or in animal
treatment. In fact, in Cote d’Ivoire, as in most of developing
countries [49], the use of antibiotics for humans and animals
is relatively unrestricted.
Furthermore, no measures of hygiene are observed in
both farms and in the process of slaughter which could cause
contamination of poultry carcasses. Since campylobacteriosis is transmitted by consumption of contaminated food,
preferably poultry, the presence of strains of antibioticresistant _Campylobacter_ on chicken meat can be a real
public health problem in Cˆote d’Ivoire. Indeed, the situation
could deteriorate more rapidly in the study area, where
there is an expansion of poultry farms with widespread
and uncontrolled use of antibiotics. Therefore, surveillance
of resistance pattern is necessary to guide rational use of
antimicrobial agents in poultry farms.
In conclusion, we reported the presence of high contamination in poultry in Cˆote d’Ivoire by thermophilic
_Campylobacter_ and high resistance to antimicrobials of the
fluoroquinolone family. These results show the need to
strengthen the implementation of specific control procedures
to decrease the contamination of poultry meat by _Campy-_
_lobacter_ and the necessity to reduce using of antibiotics in
poultry sector. This study also shows the need to establish an
efficient system for the control of _Campylobacter_ in chickens.
