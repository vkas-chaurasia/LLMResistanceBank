Hiko _et al._ - _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 in retail raw meat products of Ethiopia


**Materials and Methods**
_Ethical considerations_

The research project was approved by the
Academic Commission of the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia.

_Study area_

Over a period of 7 months (October 2006 to April
2007), a prevalence survey of _E. coli_ O157:H7 was
conducted on meat samples obtained from legally
registered butcher shops, municipal abattoirs, and
selected export abattoirs at Debre-Zeit and Modjo
towns, which are allocated at 45 and 70 km,
respectively from the Addis Ababa, the capital city of
the Federal Republic of Ethiopia.

_Sample collection, handling and transport_

A total of 738 raw meat samples were collected
from municipal abattoirs (n=177), export abattoirs
(n=433) and butcher shops (n=128 (Table 1). The meat
samples were from bovines (n=250), sheep (n=243) and
goat (n=245). Of the 738 meat samples, 406 (55%) and
333 (45%) were collected from Debre Zeit and Modjo
Towns, respectively. All the meat samples were readyto-eat fresh and collected aseptically, placed into sterile
containers, and transported to the Microbiology
Laboratory of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Addis Ababa University, located at Debre Zeit. Samples
were transported in ice boxes and analyzed within 6 to
12 hours.

_Sample preparation and selective enrichment_



Enrichment cultures for each meat sample were
conducted by combining 25g of each sample with 225
ml of tryptone soya broth (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK)
supplemented with 20 mg/l novobiocin (Sigma,
Germany) in a stomacher bag, homogenizing for at least
2 minutes in a stomacher (Lab Blender 400, Seward
Medical, London, UK) and incubating at 37 [o] C for 16 to
18 h.

_Culture and isolation of E. coli_ O157:H7

All enriched meat samples were subsequently
subcultured onto eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar
(Difco Laboratories, USA) for primary screening of _E._
_coli_ and incubated aerobically at 37 [o] C for 24 hours.
Suspected colonies of _E. coli_ (greenish metallic sheen
appearance with dark purple centers) were
biochemically identified using API 20E gallery
(API20E/20100, bioMerieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France)
and subsequently they were further screened for _E. coli_
O157:H7. In brief, 2-3 biochemically confirmed _E. coli_
were subcultured on Sorbitol MacConkey Agar
(Oxoid), supplemented with 0.05 mg/l cefixime and 2.5
mg/l tellurite (Oxoid) (SMAC-CT) and incubated at
37 [o] C for 18 to 24 hours. Following the end of the
incubation period, the SMAC-CT agar plates were
examined for the presence of non-sorbitol fermenter
colonies and subsequently they were further processed
for serological identification. The type strain _E. coli_
O157:H7 (ATCC 43895) was placed into 10 ml of
Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) (Oxoid) and incubated
for 24 hours at 37 [o] C. The resulting culture was streaked
out on SMAC-CT agar and incubated for 24 hours at
37 [o] C. This was used as a positive control.

_Serological identification_

All non-sorbitol fermenting colonies from the
SMAC-CT agar were subjected to slide agglutination
with the _E. coli_ O157 Latex test kit (Oxoid). The latex
beads were coated with antibodies which bind to any
O157 or H7 antigens on the test organisms, forming a
visible antigen antibody precipitate [13]. Colonies
giving a precipitation reaction were confirmed as _E. coli_
O157:H7 positive.

_Antimicrobial susceptibility testing_

The isolated _E. coli_ O157:H7 strains were tested for
antibiotic resistance to thirteen antimicrobial agents
obtained from Oxoid [amikacin (AK) (30 µg),
ampicillin (AMP) (10 µg), cephalothin (KF), (30 µg),
chloramphenicol (C) (30 µg), gentamicin (CN) (10 µg),
kanamycin (K) (30 µg), nalidixic acid (30 µg) (NA),
norfloxacin (NOR) (10 µg), polymyxin B (PB) (300
units), streptomycin (S) (10 µg), trimethoprim (W)
(5µg), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (SXT) (25
µg) and tetracycline (TE) (30 µg)] using the disc
diffusion method according to the criteria of the
National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards
(NCCLS) [14]. The isolates were classified as sensitive,
intermediate, and resistant using the breakpoints of the
NCCLS [14]. A standard reference strain of _E. coli_
