test, Simmons’ citrate agar, urea agar, lysine iron agar (LIA),
and SIM medium and incubated at 37 [∘] C for 18–48 hours and
interpreted with the International Organization for Standardization guidelines [16].


_2.6. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing._ Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing on Mueller–Hinton agar (Oxoid)
using the agar disc diffusion method [17] was conducted
to determine the antibiotic-resistant profiles of each isolate.
Briefly, isolates were grown in a shaking water bath at 37 [∘] C
until obtaining a 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. The
bacterial suspension was then spread over the entire surface
of Mueller–Hinton agar plates, and antibiotic disks including amoxicillin (20 mg), ampicillin (10 mg), cephalothin
(30 mg), ceftriaxone (30 mg), gentamycin (10 mg), nalidixic
acid (30 mg), nitrofurantoin (30 mg), sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim (30 mg), and tetracycline (30 mg) were applied
on the surface of the medium and incubated at 37 [∘] C for 18–
24 hours. Following incubation, the diameters of the inhibition zone were measured in millimeters and interpreted in
accordance with CLSI guidelines [17]. Strains were evaluated
as susceptible, intermediate, and resistant. An isolate was
defined as resistant if it was resistant to one or more of the
antimicrobials. _Escherichia coli_ ATCC 25922 was used as a
quality control and standard strain.


_2.7. Statistical Analysis._ Statistical analysis was performed
using SPSS Statistics 17 (SPSS Inc., USA). Descriptive
statistics such as frequency, percentage, and/or proportion
were applied to compute the collected data from different
foods of animal origin and antimicrobial susceptibility test
results.


_2.8. Ethical Considerations._ Institutional permission to perform this study was obtained from the research and the
ethical review committee of University of Gondar, Ethiopia.
In addition, the research supporting letter was obtained
from Gondar city administration and health office, Ethiopia.
Confidentiality was ensured through the use of codes in
records.



**3. Result**


_3.1. Prevalence._ In this study, 21 (5.5%) out of 384 samples
were found to be positive for _Salmonella_ spp. (Table 1)
through standard culture technique. All these isolates
obtained from positive samples were confirmed primarily
with the help of _Salmonella_ spp. growth and morphological
characteristics on selective media and then with biochemical
tests (Table S1 in Supplementary Material available online at
[http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4290506).](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4290506) _Salmonella_ isolates
were detected from 6 (12%) of the raw meat samples, 2
(8%) of the minced meat samples, 1 (2.9%) of the burger
samples, 9 (18%) of the raw eggs, and 3 (6%) of the raw milk
samples. However, cottage cheese, cream cake, egg sandwich,
pasteurized milk, and pizza test samples were _Salmonella_
negative. _Salmonella_ was recovered more frequently from
raw meat and raw eggs than from minced meat and/or raw
milk. Among the sample sources, samples examined from the
butcher house and retail shops with the prevalence of 13% and
13.3%, respectively, were the most contaminated compared
with the others (data not shown).


_3.2. Antimicrobial Resistance Profile._ The overall proportion
of antimicrobial susceptibility test and the results of
antimicrobial resistance of _Salmonella_ spp. isolated from
raw meat, minced meat, raw eggs, and raw milk are given
in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Of the total 21 _Salmonella_
isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility test using
nine different antimicrobials, a total of 10 (47.6%) _Salmonella_
isolates were found to be resistant to one or more than one
(multidrug) of the antimicrobials, and 6 (28.6%) isolates
showed an intermediate sensitivity to one or more antimicrobials, and 5 (23.8%) isolates were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials. The _Salmonella_ isolate from the burger sample
was susceptible to all tested antimicrobial agents. In relation to the total _Salmonella_ isolates tested, 42.6%, 28.6%,
and 14.3% were found to be relatively resistant to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and ampicillin,
respectively, while 9.5%–19% were intermediately resistant
to tetracycline, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, and
